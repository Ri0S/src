The Abandoned AppleRhee young kimSomeone had partially eaten and thrown away an apple.It was all black, being covered with a swarm of flies, and struck me as being like a nun sharing what remained of it’s life with all of the flies who were buzzing around it.Beneath a drooping willow tree, the apple’s sweet fragrance slowly drifted away.With the remnants of it’s flesh and moisture, the little green apple freely distributed it’s love to the flies wafting through it’s scent even it had been rejected earlier.What a beautiful rebirth it was.
