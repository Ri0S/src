After the MovieRhee young kimI went to see a Hong Kong movie this afternoon.With clothes torn and tattered, Jackie Chan leaps down from the roof in spite of his broken and asks me a question:“Have you played the part you’ve been cast in on life’s stage as if your very survival depended upon it?”“I’ve actually always shied away from it because I might get bruised a little.”And now the day is ending and the stunt man is nowhere in sight.Just like Jackie Chan who gets beaten up while rolling around on broken glass and stands up again, is my life at this point also a box office smash?
