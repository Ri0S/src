미친 각시 / 이주희 처음엔 그랬어미쳐도 설 미쳐서휘영청 달만 뜨면 소리 없이 울더래 촛불 켜는 그믐밤옆구리가 시리다고꼭꼭 눌러 편지를 써 주소 없이 부치더래 꽃으로 살려나갈대로 살려나갸웃갸웃 셈을 세다 그만 몹쓸 병에 든 것 같아 별별 수작 다 부리며너랑 살고 싶다고 옷고름 풀리도록 거리를 헤맸다지 가슴속엔 상사화가 자란다나가슴속엔 활화산이 터진다나그러다가 두 눈에 섧게 우는 별이 왔어 남은 세월 내어주고 들꽃과 맞바꿔서봉두산발 까치머리나비처럼 꽂았더래 헐벗어 떨면서도네가 좋아죽겠다고풍파에 몸 맡긴 체 돌 맞고도 히죽히죽 그냥 그냥 좋아죽겠다며 웃더래네가.....  Insane Bride / Lee, JooHee It started like this- She was crazy but not so seriously - On a night of full moon.  Was she silently sobbing. On a crescent night,Appealing her pack painOn a note written in square letters.Mailed she the letter without address. Wanted to live like a flower?Wanted to live like a reed? Wandering, debating was she Was it why she got crazy? Speaking something nonsense, Mumbling “I want to marry you" Trotting all around the town with half-naked body. Saying, “My heart grows with love" Saying, “My heart bursts with love" Then her eyes filledwith welling tears. Trading her remaining days With a wild flower.That flower she had on her disheveled headLike a butterfly on a bush. Her shaking chilled body,Keep muttering “I love you"Her body at the mercy of scorn,Smiling face even at being stone. Muttering “I just you – no reason--"With her grinning face, "I am in deep love" With you!" *(Slight differences with English translation)
