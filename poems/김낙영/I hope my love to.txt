I hope my love to                                                                    - Kim, Nak Young - I hope my love to start with mind that beats high when staring at stars in the night sky.I hope my love to be the longing that comes across my mind when closed my eyes. I hope my love to have emotion that takes the hand gently,which was held out with hesitation.I hope my love to have humanity that dries a bead of sweat sharinghis/her burdens.I hope my love to have kindness that walks together sharing an umbrella in rainy days.I hope my love to have romantic feelings that can leave footprints of the two walking togetherby the street trees in heavy snowy days.I hope my love to be the comfortable one that hugs me gently throwing his overcoat on my shoulders in cold winter.I hope my love to be the eternal love that the two can become one facing each other.
