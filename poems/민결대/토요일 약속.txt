Pitched past pitch of grief, More pangs will, schooled at forepangs, wilder wring. Comforter, where, where is your comforting? Mary, mother of us, where is your relief? My cries heave, herds-long; huddle in a main, a chief Woe, w&oacute;rld-sorrow; on an &aacute;ge-old anvil wince and sing — Then lull, then leave off. Fury had shrieked 'No ling- ering! Let me be fell: force I must be brief."'      O the mind, mind has mountains; cliffs of fall Frightful, sheer, no-man-fathomed. Hold them cheap May who ne'er hung there. Nor does long our small Durance deal with that steep or deep. Here! creep, Wretch, under a comfort serves in a whirlwind: all Life death does end and each day dies with sleep.   Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844-1889) was an English poet. His poem - 'No worst, there is none. Pitched past pitch of grief.' - is a poem, as the title tells the reader, about grief. The title is at first glance a bit of a mouthful. There is nothing cryptic about it. It tells the reader plain and straight what the poem is about. Nature, religion and melancholy were popular themes with Hopkins. This poem focuses on two of those – religion and melancholy. The mark of a good poet is to be able to communicate through the ages. Regardless of when a poem was written it should be understandable and relevant. Hopkins poem does this, despite the fact that way the poem is written is not a mode the modern reader is comfortable. Things such as beginning a sentence with ‘O’ or the use words like woe belong to the era that Hopkins was writing in. Nonetheless, the meaning behind his words shines through the Victorian style. The poem is in two stanzas. The first explains Hopkins’s feelings of grief. It seems too personal a poem to be anyone else’s.  He bemoans the lack of comfort from his religion, in line 3: “Comforter, where, where is your comforting?” Clearly, he feels let down by God. However, in line 4 he looks toward Mary “mother of us,” it seems it is her he asks where is her relief? This, the inclusion of Mary, gives the poem a Catholic feel. The first stanza is an intense one of pain, during which there is no let up. In the second stanza Hopkins turns to the human mind: “O the mind, mind has mountains; cliffs of fall Frightful, sheer, no-man-fathomed.” The pace or the painfulness of the poem does not let up till the end. He ends with this less than cheerful insight: “…Here! creep, Wretch, under a comfort serves in a whirlwind: all Life death does end and each day dies with sleep.” For Hopkins, then, it is only in sleep, when the day dies that there is any temporary relief from the grief that he is feeling. All in all, Hopkins poem is an intense storm of a poem. In the poem he expresses his deepest feelings of despair and the feelings of frustration with his faith. This should offer some kind of comfort, but within the human mind, there is very little respite from these storms. This is a bleak poem, but one that is articulated in a way that is interesting and thrilling to read.    http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/173663    http://www.helium.com/items/2324036-poetry-analysis-no-worst-there-is-none-by-gerard-manley-hopkins
