You know, one day you look at the person and you see something more than you did the night before. Like a switch has been flicked somewhere. And the person who was just a friend is... suddenly the only person you can ever imagine yourself with”  The most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love, and to let it come in.”        “So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half-asleep, even when they're busy doing things they think are important. This is because they're chasing the wrong things. The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.”    Be brave. Even if you're not, pretend to be. No one can tell the difference.” http://thinkexist.com/quotation/be_brave-even_if_you-re_not-pretend_to_be-no_one/7128.html http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html
