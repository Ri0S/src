howl  0036517188138995/9196727976 HOWLby Allen Ginsberg   I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix, angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night, who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz, who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated, who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war, who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull,who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall, who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York, who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night with dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares,alcohol and cock and endless balls, incomparable blind; streets of shuddering cloud and lightning in the mind leaping toward poles of Canada & Paterson,illuminating all the motionless world of Time between, Peyote solidities of halls, backyard green tree cemetery dawns, wine drunkenness over the rooftops, storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon blinking traffic light, sun and moon and tree vibrations in the roaring winter dusks of Brooklyn,ashcan rantings and kind king light of mind, who chained themselves to subways for the endless ride from Battery to holy Bronx on benzedrine until the noise of wheels and children brought them down shuddering mouth-wracked and battered bleak of brain all drained of brilliance in the drear light of Zoo,who sank all night in submarine light of Bickford's floated out and sat through the stale beer afternoon in desolate Fugazzi's, listening to the crack of doom on the hydrogen jukebox, who talked continuously seventy hours from park to pad to bar to Bellevue to museum to the Brooklyn Bridge, lost battalion of platonic conversationalists jumping down the stoops off fire escapes off windowsills off Empire State out of the moon, yacketayakking screaming vomiting whispering facts and memories and anecdotes and eyeball kicks and shocks of hospitals and jails and wars, whole intellects disgorged in total recall for seven days and nights with brilliant eyes, meat for the Synagogue cast on the pavement, who vanished into nowhere Zen New Jersey leaving a trail of ambiguous picture postcards of Atlantic City Hall, suffering Eastern sweats and Tangerian bone-grind-ings and migraines of China under junk-with-drawal in Newark's bleak furnished room, who wandered around and around at midnight in the railroad yard wondering where to go, and went, leaving no broken hearts, who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars boxcars racketing through snow toward lonesome farms in grand-father night, who studied Plotinus Poe St. John of the Cross telepathy and bop kabbalah because the cosmos instinctively vibrated at their feet in Kansas, who loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking visionary indian angels who were visionary indian angels, who thought they were only mad when Baltimore gleamed in supernatural ecstasy, who jumped in limousines with the Chinaman of Oklahoma on the impulse of winter midnight streetlight smalltown rain, who lounged hungry and lonesome

Ginsberg writes that Part I ânames the monster...that preys on the Lamb.â The Lamb, in this case, are the âbest mindsâ and âangel headed hipstersâ of Part I.    Part II uses a great deal of metaphor and symbolism to make social and political points. Thus, it is different from Part I, which was mainly a fractured narrative of the lives of the Beat generation. Though one could certainly make social and political inferences from Part I, and Ginsberg does challenge the power authorities of institutions like higher education, mental health, and public safety, the social forces that cause the hardships, violence, and addiction in the lives of the âbest mindsâ are not named beyond vague references. Part II, however, gives a very specific name for these social forces - âMoloch.â The use of the name âMoloch,â a name traditionally associated with specific gods or rituals from ancient Middle Eastern and Mediterranean religion, is most commonly used to denote a power or force that demands great sacrifice. The figure has been used in a variety of modern artistic settings, including John Miltonâs âParadise Lostâ and Fritz Langâs pioneering film âMetropolis.â In Ginsbergâs poem, it comes to symbolize all of societyâs great evils: corporate power and domination, militarization, governmental violence and oppression, just to name a few. Ginsberg first thought of the name âMolochâ when out in the streets of San Francisco one evening with a friend and future life-long partner, Peter Orlovsky. Both took peyote, a drug with mind altering effects, and walked the streets, having hallucinations. As they walked, Ginsberg saw the St. Francis Hotel, a landmark building in downtown San Francisco. The lights and shape of the building and the effects of the peyote, made Ginsberg see, ârobot upstairs eyes & skullface, in smoke....â Ginsberg names this monster Moloch. The became the symbol of social oppression, the cause of the demise and insanity of the âbest minds.â Analysis Lines 1-22 Ginsberg begins Part II with a reference to the death of his friend Bill Cannastra: âWhat sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up / their brains and imagination?â (1-2). Cannastra was a friend of Ginsbergâs from his New York days. One evening, while riding the subway train, Bill, attempting a humorous stunt, accidentally fell out of the window of the train they were on. He was dragged behind the train and killed. Ginsberg references Cannastraâs death in Part I as well, writing of a âbest mindâ who âfell out of the subway window....â Billâs death, Ginsberg suggests, gives us the context for the power of the evil Moloch - the power to destroy and to drive one to insane acts. Part II is a lengthy description of this âMoloch.â Ginsberg begins by describing the economic hardships of those who do not have the luxuries and life of wealthier people. Moloch, representing the values of capitalism, has the power to give to certain persons and to take away from others. Moloch becomes a âheavy judger of men!â (7) Ginsberg, who kept a lifelong affiliation with communism, found such values to be abhorrent and destructive to society.  Moloch also represents the immoral power of government. In lines eight through eleven Ginsberg describes Moloch as âthe crossbone soulless jail- / house and Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judg- / ment! Moloch the vast stone of war! Moloch the stunned govern- / ments!â The word âCongressâ is used in a double sense here. It references both the actual Congress of the United States, a place of âsorrowsâ in Ginsbergâs thought, but it also means a collection, or gathering. The United States government, a body ultimately âof the peopleâ and âby the peopleâ does not collect the peopleâs hopes and ambitions as much as it collects their sorrows and inability to advance. Moloch is also the soulless dominance of industry and corporate power. Ginsbergâs ideas of industry, explored more fully in other poems such as âAmerica,â were drastically different from the capitalism of the United States. Ginsberg often references leftist politics and policies in his poetry - workerâs rights, socialist activism, and the distribution of wealth. Ginsberg references the great cities of the world that industry had built But they are not signs of beauty and progress as others might see them. They are landscapes of nightmares. âMoloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows! Moloch whose skyscrap- / ers stand in the long streets like endless Jehovahs!â (15-16). Industry and capitalism are not just symbols of American values, Ginsberg suggests. They are the deities of American culture. The attainment of wealth is a religious pursuit. It is a devotion of the American people. Molochâs soul is âelectricity and banks,â two of the cornerstones of industry and business. Ginsberg writes that Molochâs âpoverty is the specter of genius!â (20). This is to say that American progress, created and sustained by a particular kind of American ingenuity and âgenius,â is actually a force to impoverishes the American spirit. But it is not only the spirit that is impoverished. It is a force that creates actual poverty. Lines 23-45 No one is immune from the power of Moloch, not even Ginsberg himself. He writes, making a self reference, âMoloch who entered my soul early! Moloch in whom I am a consciousness / without a body!â (25-26). Ginsberg did not necessarily mean âHowlâ to be a poem of protest, though protest certainly plays a part. âHowl,â however, is not a specific call against the Molochs of the world. Instead, this Part II is meant to show us how we are all part of the powers of Moloch. When Ginsberg suggests that Moloch entered his soul early, he means that the values of industry, capitalism, patriotism, etc. were engrained in his being from an early age just as those same values become a part of the lives of almost all Americans at some point. Resisting Moloch is useless. All are a part of its consciousness. It is the act of trying to disentangle oneâs self from the power of Moloch that drives one insane. Moloch becomes a problem for these âbest mindsâ in two ways, then. First, by being entangled in Molochâs power they risk losing their own souls and their own vision. Yet, by trying to escape the cultural hegemony of Moloch, they can only turn to lives of destruction: alcohol, drugs, or violence. Â  Lines 29-31 give the most complete description of who Moloch is in the poem. â...Robot apartments! invisible suburbs! skeleton treasuries! / blind capitals! demonic industries! spectral nations! invincible mad- / houses! granite cocks! monstrous bombs!â These lines name all of the perceived evil in society - the desire for suburban wealth, a national economy without values or morals, government that seeks only its own interest in policy, a society that places its geniuses in madhouses and who elevates to the status of genius those that only create more wealth, industry, and war.  These things have been the death of America. Ginsberg often believed himself to be a continuation of the American vision of the poet Walt Whitman. Ginsberg incorporates some of Whitmanâs style and structure in âHowl.â Lines 35 - 38 strongly echo Whitmanâs aesthetic. The âvisionsâ and âmiraclesâ of the American experience have âgone down the American / river!â The âDreams! adorations! illuminations! religions! the whole boatload of sensitive / bullshit!â Ginsberg means here to suggest that Whitmanâs vision of America - that of open spaces, nature, and individuality in the face of the growing industrialism of the United States - did not win in the end. Moloch has won. It is a part of all their lives. But the âbest mindsâ made a choice about how to live in the shadow of Moloch and Ginsberg ends Part II with this choice in lines 43 through 45. They chose to leave. Yet, their choice drove them to insanity. Ginsberg sees both blessing and curse in such a journey. He calls their laughter âholy,â yet it is still the laughter of a madman. He writes that the âbest minds,â âbade farewell!â to Molochâs America. Their farewell only led them to destruction, however. As they left âDown to the river! into the street!â they also went into insanity and destruction. They âjumped off the roof! to solitude!â
