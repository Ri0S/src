Poe's Cottage  On snowy daysMy Asian footprints carveThe white land of AmericaHer beautys complex and simple Doves fly over my headAnd writings of Poe's crawPoe, still slumbers in a wooden bedOf his cottage onÂ  Bronx colored groundsHis dreams are same as mineStars, flowers, waves, and sandOh, sweet smelling angel......... But the dead speak the same words? I want to know really what he speaksAnd how he feels when the new white worldIs struggling to build dreamsunder the cold, cold snowy landFor the lost immigrants dream.  (2000)
