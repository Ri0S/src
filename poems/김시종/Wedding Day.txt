Wedding Day                                  Kim si - jong  Oh , friend. why not share a joke with me, I feel like bursting into tears the same way I did when I won the J. literary prize, So I do now on my wedding day. What makes the fatherless so sorrowful While those with fathers seem so content Since life comes and goes Like a streak of powdery snow? Seeking a toilet To weep in secret I found mother already there, weeping
