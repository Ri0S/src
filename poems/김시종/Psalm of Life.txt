Psalm of Life                      Kim, Si - jong  Love of my child Helps me love others', too; Tilling a patch of my own land Makes me join others' worry about weather; Only the hard labor of watering My own scorched land with grains of stars Has taught me I too am An offspring of the land; Even the whispering of the rain Becomes a profound message for me.
