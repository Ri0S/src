A single human cell at the start of meiosis has 46 duplicated (2 chromatids) chromosomes. At the end of MEIOSIS I... How many cells are present? How many chromosomes are in each cell? Are the chromosomes duplicated or unduplicated? What types of cells in your body undergo meiosis? How do the daughter cells compare with each other - same or different? A single human cell at the start of meiosis has 46 duplicated (2 chromatids) chromosomes. At the end of MEIOSIS II... How many cells are present? How many chromosomes are in each cell? Are the chromosomes duplicated or unduplicated? What is the function of these daughter cells? What is the advantage of sexual reproduction over asexual reproduction (evolutionarily speaking)? Can somebody help me with these questions, please?  Thank you!  http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~altieri/resources/CAvita.htm
