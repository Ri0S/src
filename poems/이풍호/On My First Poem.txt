MODERN POETRY, no. 1, 1996 (ISSN 1089-1587) On My First Poem    Flying dove came to me in my mind When I felt like one escaping. In this, my first poem, I sought To portray the escape from the earth Filled with much worse and boredom.   In the late 1960s, day by day, On the Seoul streets, public angers Started the early mornings And ended the days discordant; People tried to talk with Those who never listened to talk; Such then disaster That I was nearly bored to death.   I could not fly; My small white dove could fly instead. Looking for peace elsewhere Just as the universe in space and time, I looked up at an evening sky Of cloudless black. Chilly were the distant moon And countless stars. I've wanted to fly away; My loneliness, my frustration! Like today after 20 years   When I think of one escaping again, O flying dove, come to me; I sing my praise to my God on high; May my dove, universe, and peace Be with me always. - May 1987  By Paul Lee 이풍호
