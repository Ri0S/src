MODERN POETRY, no. 1, 1996 (ISSN 1089-1587) Summer Morning    Summer morning slowly comes with sighing, Waking me up, saying cautious greeting. What a precious moment! What a pity! Knowing itself only savior, mighty   Dawn with lengthy shadow grows in landscape; Here my mind in sadness longs for seascape. Morning speaks again as it's a calmness; I, indeed, now feel alive in closeness.   Summer waits the fearless morning raindrops. Truly, they are God's seeds, farming teardrops. Summer air just heaves my yearning memory And slowly, blooming tiny valley lily.   Birds are singing beautifully; I, too. Over them, with silky sunshine hitherto, Ageless, hopeful, rosy summer morning Shines on restful lake mirror.   -Paul Lee, June 1990 이풍호
