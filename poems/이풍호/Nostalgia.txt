Nostalgia by Paul Lee I. October 1990(Glendale, California) I walk the forest path through autumn pines.The golden needles fall, are dropping down.Like drifting leaves, the burning needles of pinesAnd cones make me recall my native town;Nostalgia, bring me home to Yesan home. Still, there my mom and dad are waiting. Thus,Nostalgia seeds, like autumn leaves, go backTo roots of family as winter heralds us.When time was young, I walked the path home, back;Nostalgia, bring me home to Yesan home. II. Pacific Coast Highway(Malibu, California) On the sea, a small ship longs to sailLike a butterfly; under the sun,A lone train, at the town, wants to wailWhen the skies of late fall have begun;A nostalgia, like my mother, hails me. - Paul Lee 이풍호 시인
