It's Summer        It's summer. a shadow of s pring at the door like n ostalgia.                            the distant face of time makes me unveil a lamp to see stars in the night of beginning of june. creation is endless love and love starts for nothing. and                 death is six feet tall we go into darkness. summer fosters growth of a reality whose every moment is a long, long day. since talk, talk of lips told last summer, now much of our sacrifice ecomes fresh images and unforgettable memories seeing  stars in the night at the beginning of june.                          1988  - Paul Lee 이풍호
