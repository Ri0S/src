A Prayer    Sunset slowly rolls over the hills As deep and sad as dying lips. When music with unsung words comes, I become a dead leaf.   And a she-wolf, crying devil, goes Running on the autumn field. I meet wandering tales of night In a remote village.   My anxious echo weeps As the village churchbell tolls. A train comes passing by With sounds of aged legs.   Forgotten memory leads me To the brooklet of small nature And the soft touch of clouds in the sky. Life is a romance in pains.  - Paul Lee 이풍호
