Summer in Shizuoka (静岡の夏)begins from Atami (熱海)where golden sands shineand gentle waves come with breezesfrom the distant piney islands. Summer at Shizuoka Stationis rather quiet enough for me hoping to hear unheard tales from the hills and sea. White seagulls at the bank of Marinasseem lonely like a stranger of myself;As I walk down the roadin the shadow of piney hillsand see the public hot spring,my nostalgia warms my heart again. As sunset gets thicker and thicker on the piney hills and sealeaving a long summer day shadow,I get on the night train for Tokyo (東京)passing through Atami (熱海). (Paul Lee 이풍호 시, 2007년 여름)Check my literary blog : http://blog.koreadaily.com/media.asp?action=LIST&med;_usrid=impaul&fod;_no=7&page;=1&
