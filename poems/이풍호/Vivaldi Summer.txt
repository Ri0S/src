MODERN POETRY, no. 1, 1996 (ISSN 1089-1587) Vivaldi Summer   By Paul Lee A day comes with a harmony Spreading in the eastern sky. Crawling, whispering, and breaking With a calm breath, it approaches To a young wanderer.   Aimless anger is a storm of that summer Like Vivaldi experienced years ago. His youth is alive in Four Seasons; His aging memories still sing, too, In his masterpiece.   Whenever I listen to his Summer, It reminds me of the gigantic, black clouds Plummeting into the endless Moohan Stream. As our legend says, a dragon was ascending In a furious curve.   Along the dark path of rice paddies, I, as a boy, ran toward to my village Escaping from the furious dragon. (I did not hear the Vivaldi Summer then But I saw the dragon dancing in the rain.) - 이풍호
