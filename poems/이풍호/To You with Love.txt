MODERN POETRY, no. 1, 1996 (ISSN 1089-1587) To You with Love   By Paul Lee This morning I was talking to your picture. It was a one-sided conversation Since I couldn't hear anything from your lips. But the day will be today I can hear your mind of love. If not today, how can I hope I can hear you some other time?   And tonight I am writing to you. A letter to keep you in my heart. Tomorrow will be the day That I can hear your voice of love. If not tomorrow, how can we hope You and I can see some other time? - 이풍호
