MODERN POETRY, no. 2, 1996 (ISSN 1089-1587) Smile    Of seven thousand expressions You have on your face, I look forward to seeing your smile Since you are not here.   April roses are blooming again Over the old brick wall; The sky moves toward me And I feel free today.   Who in the world says our fate? And how do they tell our love? As the tides are going away, They come back in the same way.   A young poet waits so long To sing his song forever. I wake up in the night with tears; Your smile is now spring air.  - Paul Lee 이풍호
