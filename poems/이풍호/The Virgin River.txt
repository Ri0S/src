MODERN POETRY, no. 3 /4, 1997 (ISSN 1089-1587) The Virgin River   - Zion National Park, Utah, 1982      Beyond the unique formations of gentle and taming rocks, the sunshines are dropping on the morning stream through the trees, where we are stopping to examine His wonderful works.   We slowly pass the winding tunnel with both hope and desperation. My journey will not last long without you, while the river ceaselessly flows into the Zion Narrows of the taming Zion Canyon. - Paul Lee 이풍호
