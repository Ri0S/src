MODERN POETRY, no. 1, 1996 (ISSN 1089-1587) My Self   By Paul Lee Since then, all things were taken from me. I wept alone to learn something, Worked busily a day and stood to see: What will become of my life? I was thinking...   I hear my heart beating at thirty-seven; My mind sails through the night And sees my eyes waiting for heaven With heart on fire into empty twilight.   I have been alone on an wide ocean. (I hear my heart again) when sun goes down Like a long, long night of discontent; There's a desire, desire to be grown. - 이풍호
