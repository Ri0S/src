MODERN POETRY, no. 2, 1996 (ISSN 1089-1587) Little Candlelight   - for my daughter Christy     Little candlelight is burning, Shining all the memories We share together. As a Christmas tree is boasting Its painted candy canes, soft cotton snow And Baby Santa, a glorious bright star Is shining on the tree top.   Whispering all the tales we hear together, Little candlelight dances As Christmas Eve grows deeper and deeper; Your mom and me around you are singing, hoping For Santa's early coming down through the chimney.   Little candlelight growing old?Your mom and me pretend to be Santa, Smiling so graciously, Filling your red socks Hanging open at your bedsides.   Little candlelight joyously celebrates in your eyes, Having this first wonderful time We enjoy again tonight. Merry Christmas, Christy! - Paul Lee 이풍호
