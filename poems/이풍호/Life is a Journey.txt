Life is a Journey By Paul Lee 이풍호 In the night Old, old stars glittering above. So much delight! Their spirits are goodness.  In the morning Eyes of the sea long for mystery. Who will stop the rolling tides? Who has seen the sun hanging in the sky? God's principles are nature; Life goes on unceremoniously.  Don't be sad Though you are depressed. And don't care much How life goes on. Just try eagerly to find echoes Of your true self.  You can be happy; you can be sad. Life is but a journey, a journey; You were born to your own fate And your own fate is but a journey.
