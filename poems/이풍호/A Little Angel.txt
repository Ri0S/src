MODERN POETRY, no. 1, 1996 (ISSN 1089-1587) A Little Angel    Under the apple tree, Bees were buzzing free; We hummed a song When we were young.   On a sunny summer hill, Greeting me from the windowsill, Little angel smiled When the churchbell tolled.   And she said: "Every night I die."   Under the apple tree, With heartfelt melody, A cricket was chirring And the moon stood still shining.   All the autumn grass was for her When she's gone; and her Moon was covered by the snowy clouds; The little angel lay coldly in the woods.  - Paul Lee 이풍호
