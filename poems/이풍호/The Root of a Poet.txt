MODERN POETRY, no. 1, 1996 (ISSN 1089-1587) The Root of a Poet  By Paul Lee 이풍호 I put myself to set my root In Sunland, a slow small village, Where I sustained even a still day. While bringing all the memories From my past life, I took you here To convince my youth and future.   In the moonlit summer night, lying down Under the grapevine tree by the pool, As I look at you, you count the little stars As far as you can see them through the space. Falling in sleep, I learn: How you and the gigantic nature get along well, It is a wonderful thing to know That I have your imagination, Practicality and prayer.   Even in sleep, I hear this universe Which sings for a beauty and a knowledge. And I want to stand firmly on the life root Which always takes sides with us. My destined identity says that I love you While we make perfect partners; Our identities would be successful While we have a common root.
