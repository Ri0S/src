Autumn Nostalgia   - Glendale, California, 1988-92, where I lived alone  By Paul Lee   I walk the forest path through autumn pines. The golden needles fall, are dropping down. Like drifting leaves, the burning needles of pines And cones make me recall my native town; Nostalgia, bring me home, Yesan home.   Still, there my mom and dad are waiting. Thus, Nostalgia seeds, like autumn leaves, go back To roots of family as winter heralds us. When time was young, I walked the path back; Nostalgia, bring me home, Yesan home. - 이풍호
