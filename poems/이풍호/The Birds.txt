1991. 5/英詩 2편/Southwest Manuscripters News Letter, Vol.39, No. 5/Southwest Manuscripters/* 1991 Mona O'Conner Memorial Poetry Contest Honorable Mention 이풍호 Paul Lee 시인 수상작품. THE BIRDS I walked into the woods;The trees speak with the birds. Soon summer shall be gone;The leaves shall be torn. The wind will sing with rainAs your minds turn to pain.  HER PLEA I found her standing on the islandAt the entrance to the shopping mall.Her pale, motionlee face was hopefulBut little help came from the Christmas shoppers;I saw no one cared about her sadnessBeing robbed by the fading autumn light.I remember the silent sign she held:Please help... I need white shoesFor my waitress job.  - Paul Lee 이풍호 시인
