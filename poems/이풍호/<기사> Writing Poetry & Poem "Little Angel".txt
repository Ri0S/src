Among his works: "Her Plea," "A Little Angel," and others. Many of his works have been translated.Lee, who was born in 1950, immigrated to the United States in December, 1980. In 1989, he enrolled in a poetry course at UCLA, under the direction of Timothy Steele, whome he credits as his greatest influence.Initially, he wrote "free verse," but after the course, he became more open to traditional rhyme and meter as well as a change in thought and attitude.His inspiration, he adds, is derived from many sources. He enjoys writing about the universe, nature, beauty, humans, and people he comes into contact with every day. He says: "We can be inspired by anything."--- Little Angel by Paul Lee  Under the apple tree,Bees were buzzing free;We hummed a songWhen we were young. On a sunny summer hill,Greeting me from the windowsill,Little angel smiledWhen the churchbell tolled. And she said: "Every night I die." Under the apple tree,With heartfelt melody,A cicket was chirringAnd the moon stood still shinning. All the autumn grass was for herWhen she's gone; and herMoon was covered by the snowy clouds;The little angel lay coldly in the woods. - Paul Lee 이풍호 시인ㅇ
