Classic Freeloader by Paul Lee  At the Lincoln Center in New York,Yo-Yo Ma plays his elegy;David Zinman puts aside his violinAnd conducts the orchestraFor Yo-Yo Ma and me. I watch an unpaid TV programYo-Yo Ma plays.So, should I feel guilty?Uncooperative? Unappreciative?Probably... Yo-Yo Ma plays his elegy;I enjoy his playing,Sweating and his cello. I feel I'm imposingOn PBS and Yo-Yo MaSince I don't pledge for the program.Still, Yo-Yo Ma plays more numbers;Thanks, Yo-Yo Ma. Thanks, PBS.For your gernerosity! (20 October 1990)- Paul Lee 이풍호 시인
