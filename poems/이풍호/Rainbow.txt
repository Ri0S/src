Paul Lee 이풍호 (1950-  )  RAINBOW 무지개  On a July afternoon, I saw a rainbow Over the Los Angeles River.*  Chasing it closer and closer, Like a flying bridge, It kept going away.  I was almost exhausted myself Trying to catch over and over; It was still beyond my reach.  The rainbow is the God's blessing While I sleep in the nights. But I know It always disappears by morning.  This morning I found myself joyful; Happiness was here. O rainbow, I touched you!  *Los Angeles River: A river flowing through the center of Los Angeles to the Pacific Ocean.
