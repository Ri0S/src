MODERN POETRY, no. 1, 1996 (ISSN 1089-1587) Reconciliation   - Grand Canyon, Arizona, November 1990    I saw no hope of love between the Rims Because the Canyon separated them for aeons. Late autumn appeared upon the Rim; the pines Were chilled with the first silver snow. The Canyon hid the breathing Colorado River, Telling of legendary times and tales.   I saw no hope of love between us till today, And yet time passes slowly, you and I Together again. We two can rejoice Over our reawakening kinship. Ah, warm and deep nights for two lovers, We reconciled in the serene woods of Yavapai Having parted two years ago.   - Paul Lee 이풍호
