살아다시, 봄나비 훨훨꽃분홍 갈피갈피일어서는 순수여 봄잠 떨구곤나래 펴 가슴 봉긋이 새초롬한 풀잎들 이슬달고 아침마다 싱그러워간극 온데간데 싱그러워라또, 봄  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAdHkyKq9Cc  Title:Again, spring AliveAgain, springThe butterflies flyThe pink flowers are everywhereHow standing purity is After escaping of the spring sleepThe heart open for a lover with stretching a pair of oars Hanging the dews on the like as gently grasses  Every in the morning those are freshThere are no difficulties How very fresh it isAgain, spring
