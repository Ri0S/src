어둠 짙어질수록 More than more growing dark빛에 다가서고 we could approach to the light희원 자라날수록 More than more growing hope꿈 선연해지니 dream would be clear and concrete 하루마다 가쁜 숨 In each of days, there are hard breathing from the busy works마음 가득 공든 삶 but in each full of hearts, there are lives with devotion http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1eY7tyg4yg
