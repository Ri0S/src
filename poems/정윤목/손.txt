손 손마다 상흔, 삶 흔적기쁨 슬픔 사랑의 수고들 모두 다 굽이진 곡선들로  속울음 삼킨 눈물 뭉게 뭉게 피어나는 잔주름 골진미묘한 손금들 손바닥 위 수 없이 굴곡져 누워있는 사연 수고로움으로 모든 사연 익혀내고 살으리 참 살으리 땀으로 노래하네  Hands  In each hand, all of them have the traces of lives And the pains of the glee, sadness and love All they have curved lines  The tears of eating the crying of silence in depth Have been come out as if clouds' features In the unknown lines of the palm  The getting layed stories with many flections  on the hands After suffering all of their difficult and sad stories They have been singing a song that I'll live, Only live serously with genuine by perspiration Without non-stop  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zLfCnGVeL4  The Sound of Silence (Original Version from 1964)
