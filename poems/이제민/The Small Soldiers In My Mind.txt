The Small Soldiers In My Mind		-‘내 마음속의 작은 병정들’ 영작                                             이제민  The small soldiers on the board,Suffering in my mind is begin.Force exceed a fingertipIs given to speculation. A my mind is disturbedMore and more I gush out in the sky.Soldiers are suffered one after anotherAt that time, agony and pain are beginning. The inside head feel empty only spaceIt is lack, however search for a thing.Do the restoration, but miss an opportunity.He did the best. They are stand in line finelyYet this mind only regret.The story in many thingsBut hang my head in shame.
