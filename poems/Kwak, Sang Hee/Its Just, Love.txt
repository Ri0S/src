Its Just Love...Sang Hee Kwak There was a time thinking of someone, whose nameflashes deep sadness and yearninglike a forest water fog But when I think of you nowI feel very oddits not the flower, nor a young budready to blossom However, there was once a time your eyes tolerated me all When you called my name with your eyes glitteringI became a flower just to bloomred and shyAnd your words filled my lifewith jubilant thousands colors, never to fade... Its not liberty, nor chain, butembraces all, yes, its just Love!
