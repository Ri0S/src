FOXP2, the most intensively studied gene associated with language, was first discovered by Simon Fisher, Anthony Monaco and colleagues in Oxford in 2001.  The Oxford researchers were studying DNA samples from a family with distinctive speech and language difficulties. Some 15 members of the KE family, over three generations, were perfectly able to understand spoken words but struggled to string words together in response. The pattern of inheritance of the KE family’s language disorder strongly suggested that it was a dominant single-gene condition – one copy of an abnormal gene was enough to disrupt their language abilities.  Having identified a small area of the genome likely to contain this abnormal gene, the team then had a stroke of luck. One of the clinicians who had first seen the KE family came across an unrelated child with very similar symptoms, but in this case the condition was caused by a chromosome rearrangement. This rearrangement sliced through a gene in Dr Fisher’s region of interest. Sequencing of this gene – FOXP2 – in the KE family revealed a tell-tale mutation. Dr Fisher went on to study FOXP2 and its role in language and brain development in more detail. FOXP2 is a ‘master controller’ that regulates the activity of many other genes. It is active in several areas of the brain and at different stages of development. It seems to be involved in the growth of the long processes on nerve cells that connect with other nerve cells. It also affects the changes that these connections undergo during learning. Mutations in FOXP2, which have now been found in other families, may therefore interfere with the development of the brain circuitry needed for mastering spoken language. One striking aspect of FOXP2 is its evolutionary history. FOXP2 is highly conserved – the mouse version of the protein, for example, shows just three amino acid differences from the human protein. However, two of those differences occurred in our ancestors after humans split from chimpanzees, and it has been speculated that these tiny changes may have been important for the protein’s contributions to language. Intriguing findings have been obtained in studies of FOXP2 in non-speaking species. Constance Scharff’s group has looked at its role in songbirds, while Svante P&auml;&auml;bo’s team has inserted the two human amino acid changes into the mouse version of FOXP2. Remarkably, the resulting mouse pups are essentially normal but show subtle alterations in the frequency of their high-pitched vocalisations. They also show changes to neural circuits in parts of their brain, which are distinct from changes seen in mice that carry dysfunctional versions of the gene. Collectively, the results implicate FOXP2 in the brain’s ability to learn sequences of movements. In humans, it has adopted a role in the complex muscle articulation needed for speech production. It does not tell the full story of language development but it is an important chapter. References:Lai CS et al. A forkhead-domain gene is mutated in a severe speech and language disorder.
