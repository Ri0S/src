Hpoing A Star Falls To Mok-Dong Friday nightEveryone sleepsExcept for a school of goldfishDrinking waterAlongside an expressway to InchonWatching the stars aboveThe housing development in Mok-dongSeoul in a misty cloudHoping stars fallLike candyLike hailHoping a shooting star sprerads overLike flowers of cottonAt Mok-dong.  * Mok-dong, an apartment district around Kimpo-Airport (Seoul)
