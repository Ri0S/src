In the close relationships area he has studied the application of Bowlby and Ainsworth's attachment theory to research on romantic love and couple communication, relationship loss and grieving, attachment-related mental processes, and applications of attachment theory to leadership and organizations. In the field of emotions, he has used a prototype methodology to map individuals' and cultures' cognitive representations of the emotion domain and, with the help of students from other countries, is investigating everyday conceptions of emotions such as love and shame in various cultures. Dr. Shaver, who has served as Executive Officer of the Society of Experimental Social Psychology and President of the International Association for Relationship Research has received a Distinguished Career Award and an International Mentoring Award from the latter organization. He is past editor of the Review of Personality and Social Psychology and is a member of the editorial boards of Attachment and Human Development, Emotion, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Personal Relationships, and Journal of Social and Personal Relationships. He is co-editor of several books, including Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research, and Clinical Applications; Measures of Personality and Social Psychological Attitudes; Measures of Political Attitudes; Prosocial Motives, Emotions, and Behavior; Human Aggression and Violence; and The Social Psychology of Morality. With Mario Mikulincer, he coauthored a 2007 book about adult attachment research, Patterns of Attachment in Adulthood: Structure, Dynamics, and Change. A list of his publications since 1987 appears on his lab group's web site: http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/labs/Shaver
