The Wind Blows Through the Doors of My Heart   Deborah Digges는 이런 시를 쓰고 나는 아침 비내리는 시간 감상을 한다 내 가슴의 문을 통해 바람은 분다  이것을 그림으로 그린다 하루 종일 생각하며 시를 그림으로 그린다 나의 시를 다시 그림으로 그린다 나는 하나의 그림을 그린다  The wind blowsthrough the doors of my heart.It scatters my sheet musicthat climbs like waves from the piano, free of the keys.Now the notes stripped, black butterflies,flattened against the screens.The wind through my heartblows all my candles out.In my heart and its rooms is dark and windy.From the mantle smashes birds' nests, teacupsfull of stars as the wind winds round,a mist of sorts that rises and bends and blowsor is blown through the rooms of my heartthat shatters the windows,rakes the bedsheets as though someonehad just made love. And my dressesthey are lifted like brides come to reston the bedstead, crucifixes,dresses tangled in trees in the roomsof my heart. To save themI've thrown flowers to fields,so that someone would pick them upand know where they came from.Come the bees now clinging to flowered curtains.Off with the clothesline pinning anything, my mother's trousseau.It is not for me to say what is this windor how it came to blow through the rooms of my heart.Wing after wing, through the rooms of the deadthe wind does not blow. Nor the basement, no wheezing,no wind choking the cobwebs in our hair.It is cool here, quiet, a quilt spread on soil.But we will never lie down again.
