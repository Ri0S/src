I am a poet I Am a Poet Â  I am a poet I hear my thoughts as they run out of my hand I see their hurt, I make them feel better through written symphonies. I say what I feel, pain or love I cry for lost souls wandering the night aimlessly I am a poet  I want to be heard, respected I need a good friend to tell me it's okay I hope that people will remember me, I fear that children will lose their innocence too soon, I am a poet I feel when you are hurt I try to make you understand through my words, and I wonder if my message gets across I dream of a world changed by love I am a poet
