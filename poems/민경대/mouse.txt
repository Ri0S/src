mouse   Targeted (Floxed/Frt) Mutation:  Insertion    Vector: L1L2_Bact_P   The L1L2_Bact_P cassette was inserted at position 33023104 of Chromosome 15 upstream of the critical exon(s) (Build GRCm38). The cassette is composed of an FRT site followed by lacZ sequence and a loxP site. This first loxP site is followed by neomycin under the control of the human beta-actin promoter, SV40 polyA, a second FRT site and a second loxP site. A third loxP site is inserted downstream of the targeted exon(s) at position 33024061. The critical exon(s) is/are thus flanked by loxP sites. A "conditional ready" (floxed) allele can be created by flp recombinase expression in mice carrying this allele. Subsequent cre expression results in a knockout mouse. If cre expression occurs without flp expression, a reporter knockout mouse will be created. Further information on targeting strategies used for this and other KOMP alleles can be found at http://www.knockoutmouse.org/aboutkompstrategies.
