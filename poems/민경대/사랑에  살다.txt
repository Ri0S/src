사랑에 살다  Life in a Love Escape me?Never-Beloved!While I am  I, and You are You.So long as the world cpntains us both,Me the loving and You the loth,While the ole eludes, must the other pursue....But what if I fail of my purpose here?It is but to keep the nerves at strain.To dry one's eyes and laugh at s fail,And baffled, get up to begin again--So the chase takes up one's life, that's all...
