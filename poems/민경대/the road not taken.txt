the road not taken  영어를 가장 잘할수 잇는 길은 영어를 공부하지 않는 길이다영어를 아주 잘하는 길은 영어를 아주 잘 하지지 않도록 목을 추기는 일이다영어를 아주 잘하는 일은 아무런 걱정없이 산을 오르는 일이다영어는 모든 사람들의 세게이다영어는 하나의ㅏ 산을 움직이지는 않는다영어는 바둑판을 아는 것만큼 어럽지 않다영어는 그냥 죽기전에 조금 알것같다 영어는 아무것도 아니다 Transcript Perhaps if I spend an hour—or at the most two hours, when I'm feeling really inspired—I'm done for the day and then there's the problem of what to do with the other twenty-two or twenty-three hours of the day. I feel I should be doing something important. But what? I usually don't write autobiographical poetry, but this sort of turned out that way accidentally; I realized after I'd finished it, since in fact I did have a brother who died when we were both children. [Ashbery reads "The History of My Life"] I always wanted to go to France, ever since I was a child and read French fairy tales and writers like Balzac and Proust. It was just a thing I always wanted to do and ended up doing.  It took me a while to adjust to being in a country where a foreign language was spoken. My own poetry derives very much from hearing colloquial—or even worse, American—being spoken around me, especially in New York where you'd overhear strange things being said and I'd often incorporate them into poems. I didn't have that sort of cushion in France, and it took me a while to adjust and to learn how to write all over again without the background noise of American in my ears.     http://poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/20340  http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4218340653683595458&hl;=en
