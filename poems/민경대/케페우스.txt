케페우스  인간 슈퍼 컴퓨터를 이기지 못한다나는 오늘 비로서 케페우스를 본다 이제는 인간은 모든 것을 초월한 초능력 컴퓨터를 만든다 4000개의 중앙처리장치를 포함한 cepheus 이다 오늘은 한번 케페우스라는 제목으로 부제목은 "프레너미" 영화를 만든다 아니 현살속에  이런 영화를 본다"Cepheus" a poker program developed by University of Alberta Computer Poker Research Group which was unveiled in Canada yesterday is "unbeatable" at Limit Hold'em claim scientists. Just as with humans, the programme learns from its mistakes, collating an enormous database of "regrets" which enable it to minimalize errors. It learns which moves pay off, and which cost it the hand. The biggest advanatge Cepheus has over its human counterparts, however, is that for two months straight it played 24 trillion hands per second - meaning that it has already played more poker hands than have ever been played in the whole of human history. Cepheus is being hailed as a milestone in artifical intelligence of its kind, as previous programmes which have "solved" games have only been successful in "perfect information" endeavours such as Chess and Draughts (Checkers), where all of the historical moves and information are available. In poker you will never have perfect information as your opponents hole cards are never revealed during play. As such Cepheus is the first "unbeatable" programme developed to make optimal decisions with imperfect information. Cepheus will not win every hand of course, and, according to Neil Burch, a computer scientist who helped develop Cepheus, “Cepheus starts off with a strategy that’s quite terrible,” said Burch. “But every time it plays a hand it comes up with a better strategy. Cepheus loses to no one over a long enough time. You just have to play enough hands so that luck goes away.” For those who want to learn more, the developers talk about how they developed Cepheus in the latest online edition of Science Journal  For those of you who fancy earning some bragging rights, you can play against Cepheus at the Univeristy of Alberta's website . However, you might want to get out while the going's good, because the chances are you won't stay on top for long!   http://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%84%B8%ED%8E%98%EC%9A%B0%EC%8A%A4%EC%9E%90%EB%A6%AC http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/new-computer-program-cepheus-is-said-to-be-unbeatable-at-poker-9978706.html
