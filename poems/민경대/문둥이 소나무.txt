Artist note What to do.What to do.  I will have to do my best with all my heart. Time is going past 2 o'clock in the morning.The lighting of the workshop is the backing of a column supporting a roof, An unknown warrior. Leper pine. Air on G.Abandoned UN forces. Peace and rest. The souls buried on the basis of historical facts. The works which are made to announce the sacrificed victims are kept in the dark.I am not a person who draws pictures well, but I am working on this work only when I am very impressed with all my heart and soul.  The materials used in the works are wood vinegar, burning, iron powder, ash, tar,  minerals, paints and everything else.When you think about it, you write it. Most of the material is what you burned and left behind.I use these materials because I know the characteristics of the materials based on my experience through my life.The material that is buried in the canvas and the substances are compounded and swollen like bread, and the paint is mixed, and the changing color does not keep the eyes closed at the beginning and the end.Flowers that bloom when I work I like things like iron plate Mixing and mixing materials and phenomena that do not stop and change over time keep my eyes on my paintings all over my body.Picture Picture Picture What is drawing pictures for me? Just as a matter of fact tears flow through tears.During the period of 24 hours or 365 days, the painting will continue to change and the color of the natural light will unfold. If you wait for a long period of time, your sacrifice will shine upon you.The earth is peace and sanctuary  September 22, 201703:15 amGyeongbuk StationSeoul Metropolitan Museum of Art 2Mi-Kyung Kim
