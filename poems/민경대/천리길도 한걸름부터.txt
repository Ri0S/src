천리길도 한 걸음 부터  12.... 1000 The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” ― Lao Tzu  What does this mean "the journey of a thousand leagues begins from beneath your feet?" : : : Vimala Raheja : : : : It means that a long journey can seem overwhelming until you start it. So, if a destination is a thousand miles/leagues away, it might be impossible to imagine ever arriving but by taking the first step is easy. Take enough single steps and you'll arrive. : : It also implies that any overwhelming project is more manageable if broken up into smaller tasks. : Another version: "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." Said by Confucius according to Quoteland.com Not Confucius, but Laozi (or Lao-tzu). 64.That which is at rest is easy to grasp.That which has not yet come about is easy to plan for.That which is fragile is easily broken.That which is minute is easily scattered.Handle things before they arise.Manage affairs before they are in a mess. A thick tree grows from a tiny seed.A tall building arises from a mound of earth.A journey of a thousand miles starts with one step.Contriving, you are defeated;Grasping, you lose.   http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/20/messages/337.html  That has got to be one of the best known “getting started” quotations ever. However long and complicated any endeavor might be, it always needs to be initiated with something short and simple. It could also be interpreted to show that no journey ever gets completed that isn’t started. There’s just so many useful ways that you can try to interpret those few words.  Once you get started, you only have to do one step at a time. Getting started is by far the hardest part.  If you need more help with the writing process, please feel free to let me know. Good luck!Source(s):I'm a high school English teacher.   http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/24004.html  http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/2622245.Lao_Tzu http://www.literaturepage.com/\  http://www.literaturepage.com/read/poe-annabel-lee-1.html    It was many and many a year ago,     In a kingdom by the sea, That a maiden lived whom you may know     By the name of ANNABEL LEE; - And this maiden she lived with no other thought     Than to love and be loved by me.  I was a child and She was a child,     In this kingdom by the sea, But we loved with a love that was more than love -     I and my ANNABEL LEE - With a love that the wing�d seraphs of Heaven     Coveted her and me.  And this was the reason that, long ago,     In this kingdom by the sea, A wind blew out of a cloud by night     Chilling my ANNABEL LEE; So that her high-born kinsmen came     And bore her away from me, To shut her up, in a sepulchre     In this kingdom by the sea.  The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,     Went envying her and me; Yes! that was the reason (as all men know,     In this kingdom by the sea) That the wind came out of the cloud, chilling     And killing my ANNABEL LEE.  But our love it was stronger by far than the love     Of those who were older than we -     Of many far wiser than we - And neither the angels in Heaven above     Nor the demons down under the sea Can ever dissever my soul from the soul     Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE: -  For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams     Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE; And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes     Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE; And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride     In her sepulchre there by the sea -     In her tomb by the side of the sea.
