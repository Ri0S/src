양의 해  나는 외로운 세상 양처럼 살고 싶어 목 놓아 소리치며 호랑이가 많이 사는 마을에 가서 올해만은 양들이 소리치며 호랑이 눈을 후려 파고 이 겨울에 난로를 만들어 동해의 아침해를 만든다 나의 친구들이여 내가 호랑이 눈을 파서 만든 동해의 해를 보러 29일부터 1월 4일 까지 2일은 호랑이 얼굴을 본다 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnp1e3tMTFo  내년은 양띠다 양에 대한 나의 생각은 모든 세상은 양만이 아닌 호랑이 들도 산다는 사실은 나는 12년에 한번은 느낀다 이제 내가 12년만에 양이 산다든  사실을 아는 해 그리고 다시 12년후에 내가 다시 만난다면 다시 한번 만 더 양의 해를 맞이하고 이 세상하고 작별하고 싶다 https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/blake/william/innocence/ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2dS4FE1GXY http://www.atu2.com/lyrics/tracks.src?VID=221  I was chasing down the days of fear Chasing down a dream before it disappeared I was aching to be somewhere near Your voice was all I heard]  I was shaking from a storm in me Haunted by the spectres that we had to see Yeah, I wanted to be the melody Above the noise, above the hurt  I was young, not dumb Just wishing to be blinded By you, brand new And we were pilgrims on our way  I woke up at the moment When the miracle occurred Heard a song that made some sense  Out of the world Everything I ever lost Now has been returned In the most beautiful sound I’d ever heard  We got language so we can’t communicate Religion so I can love and hate Music so I can exaggerate my pain And give it a name  I was young, not dumb Just wishing to be blinded By you, brand new And we were pilgrims on our way  I woke up at the moment When the miracle occurred Heard a song that made some sense  Out of the world Everything I ever lost Now has been returned In the most beautiful sound I’d ever heard  We can hear you, hear you We can year you We can hear you, hear you  I woke up at the moment When the miracle occurred I get so many things I don’t deserve Everything I ever lost All the stolen voices Will someday be returned The most beautiful sound I’d ever heard  Your voices will be heard Your voices will be heard "Every Breaking Wave"   Every breaking wave on the shore Tells the next one there'll be one more And every gambler knows that to lose Is what you're really there for  Summer I was fearlessness Now I speak into an answer phone Like every falling leave on the breeze Winter wouldn't leave it alone Alone  If you go If you go your way and I go mine Are we so Are we so helpless against the tide Baby, every dog on the street Knows that we’re in love with defeat Are we ready to be swept off our feet And stop chasing every breaking wave  Every sailor knows that the sea Is a friend made enemy And every shipwrecked soul knows what it is To live without intimacy  I thought I heard the captain’s voice But it's hard to listen while you preach Like every broken wave on the shore This was as far as I can reach  If you go If you go your way and I go mine Are we so Are we so helpless against the tide Baby, every dog on the street Knows that we’re in love with defeat Are we ready to be swept off our feet And stop chasing every breaking wave  The waves know where are the rocks And drowning is no sin You know where my heart is The same place that yours has been And we know the fear to win And so we end before we begin Before we begin  If you go If you go your way and I go mine Are we so Are we so helpless against the tide Baby, every dog on the street Knows that we’re in love with defeat Are we ready to be swept off our feet And stop chasing every breaking wave  Innocence 2014  Barbara, Santa Barbara Barbara, Santa Barbara Barbara, Santa Barbara Barbara, Santa Barbara Barbara, Santa Barbara Barbara, Santa Barbara Barbara, Santa Barbara Barbara, Santa Barbara Barbara, Santa Barbara Barbara, Santa Barbara  California Then we fell into the shining sea The weight that drags your heart down Well, that’s what took me  Where I need to be Which is here, out on Zuma Watching you cry like a baby California, at the dawn You thought would never come But it did like it always does  All I know And all I need to know Is there is no  Yeah, there is no end to love  I didn’t call you  Words can scare a thought away Everyone’s a star in our town It’s just your light gets dimmer If you have to stay In your bedroom, in a mirror Watching yourself cry like a baby California, blood orange sunset Brings you to your knees I’ve seen for myself There’s no end to grief That’s how I know  That’s how I know And why I need to know That there is no Yeah, there is no end to love All I know and all I need to know  Is there is no  Yeah, there is no end to love  Barbara, Barbara There is no end to love  All I know and all I need to know  Is there is no  Yeah, there is no end to love We come and go But stolen days you don’t give back Stolen days are just enough  "Song For Someone"   You got a face not spoiled by beauty I have some scars from where I’ve been You’ve got eyes that can see right through me You’re not afraid of anything you’ve seen I was told that I would feel nothing the first time I don’t know how these cuts heal But in you I found a rhyme  If there is a light You can’t always see And there is a world We can’t always be If there is a dark That we shouldn’t doubt And there is a light Don’t let it go out  And this is a song A song for someone This is a song A song for someone  You let me into a conversation A conversation only we could make You break and enter my imagination Whatever’s in there It’s yours to take I was told I’d feel nothing the first time You were slow to heal  But this could be the night  If there is a light You can’t always see And there is a world We can’t always be If there is a dark Within and without And there is a light Don’t let it go out  And this is a song A song for someone This is a song A song for someone  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  And I’m a long way  From your hill of Calvary And I’m a long way From where I was and where I need to be If there is a light You can’t always see There is a world We can’t always be If there is a kiss I stole from your mouth And there is a light Don’t let it go out  The star that gives us light Has been gone a while But it’s not an illusion The ache in my heart Is so much a part of who I am  Something in your eyes Took a thousand years to get here Something in your eyes Took a thousand years, a thousand years  Hold me close  Hold me close and don’t let me go Hold me close Like I’m someone that you might know Hold me close The darkness just lets us see Who we are I’ve got your life inside of me  Iris, Iris  Once we are born We begin to forget The very reason we came But you I’m sure I’ve met Long before the night The stars went out We’re meeting up again  Hold me close  Hold me close and don’t let me go Hold me close Like I’m someone that you might know Hold me close The darkness just lets us see Who we are I’ve got your life inside of me  Iris, Iris  The stars are bright But do they know The universe is beautiful but cold  You took me by the hand I thought that I was leading you But it was you made me your man Machine, I dream where you are  Iris standing in the hall She tells me I can do it all Iris wakes to my nightmare Don’t fear the world It isn’t there Iris playing on the strand She buries the boy beneath the sand Iris says that I will be the death of her It was not me  Iris, Iris  She said free yourself to be yourself If only you could see yourself Free yourself to be yourself If only you could see  The world is spinning fast tonight You can hurt yourself tryin’ to hold on To what you used to be I’m so glad the past is gone  Been out in the wild Been out in the night Been out of your mind Do you live here or is this a vacation  Volcano You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know Volcano Something in you wants to blow Volcano You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know  Your eyes were like landing lights They used to be the clearest blue Now you don’t see so well The future’s gonna land on you  Been out in the wild Been out in the night Been out of your mind Do you live here or is this a vacation  Volcano You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know Volcano Something in you wants to blow Volcano You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know You’re on a piece of ground above a volcano  You were alone And now you’re not alone You were alone But you are rock n’ roll You and I are rock n’ roll But you are rock n’ roll You and I are rock n’ roll  Oh, volcano You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know Volcano Something in you wants to blow Volcano You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know You’re on a piece of ground above a volcano  Face down on a broken street There’s a man in the corner In a pool of misery I’m in white van  As a red sea covers the ground  Metal crash I can’t tell what it is But I take a look And now I’m sorry I did 5:30 on a Friday night 33 good people cut down  I don’t believe anymore I don’t believe anymore  Face down on a pillow of shame There are some girls with a needle Tryin’ to spell my name My body’s not a canvas My body’s now a toilet wall  I don’t believe anymore I don’t believe anymore  Raised by wolves Stronger than fear Raised by wolves We were raised by wolves Raised by wolves Stronger than fear If I open my eyes You disappear  Running wild Running wild  Running wild Boy sees his father Crushed under the weight Of a cross in a passion Where the passion is hate Running wild Blue mink Ford I’m gonna detonate in your den Running wild Blood in the house Blood in the street The worst things in the world Are justified by belief Running wild Registration 1385-WZ  Running wild I don’t believe anymore Running wild I don’t believe anymore  Raised by wolves Stronger than fear Raised by wolves We were raised by wolves Raised by wolves Stronger than fear If I open my eyes You disappear  Running wild Running wild Running wild Running wild Running wild  I was running down the road The fear was all I knew I was looking for a soul that’s real Then I ran into you And that cherry blossom tree Was a gateway to the sun And friendship, once it’s won It’s won, it’s one  Northside  Just across the river to the Southside That’s a long way here  All the green and all the gold The hurt you hide The joy that you hold The foolish pride That gets you out the door Up on Cedarwood Cedarwood Road  Sleepwalking down the road Not waking from these dreams‘Cause it’s never dead It’s still my head It was a warzone in my teens I’m still standing on that street Still need an enemy The worst ones I can’t see You can, you can  Northside  Just across the river from the Southside That’s a long way here  All the green and all the gold The hurt you hide And the joy that you hold The foolish pride That sends you back for more Up on Cedarwood Cedarwood Road  If the door is open it isn’t theft You can’t return to where you’ve never left Blossoms falling from a tree They cover you and cover me Symbols clashing, bibles smashing Paint the world you need to see Sometimes fear is the only place That we can call our home Cedarwood Road  And a heart that is broken  Is a heart that is open Open, open   Morning, your toast Your tea and sugar Read about the politician’s lover Go through the day Like a knife through butter Why don’t you You dress in the colours of forgiveness Your eyes as red as Christmas Purple robes are folded on the kitchen chair  You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight In your dreams everything is alright Tomorrow dawns like someone else’s suicide You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight  Dreams It’s a dirty business, dreaming Where there is silence and not screaming Where there’s no daylight There’s no healing, no no  You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight In your dreams everything is alright Tomorrow dawns like a suicide But you’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight  Hope is where the door is When the church is where the war is Where no one can feel no one else’s pain  You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight In your dreams everything is alright Tomorrow dawns like a suicide But you’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight Sleep like a baby tonight Like a bird, your dreams take flight Like St. Francis covered in light You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight

your soul Somebody stepped inside your soul Little by little they robbed and stole Till someone else was in control  You think it’s easier To put your finger on the trouble When the trouble is you And you think it’s easier To know your own tricks Well, it’s the hardest thing you’ll ever do  I have a will for survival So you can hurt me And then hurt me some more I can live with denial But you’re not my troubles anymore  Somebody stepped inside your soul Somebody stepped inside your soul Little by little they robbed and stole Till someone else was in control  Somebody stepped inside your soul Somebody stepped inside your soul Little by little they robbed and stole Till someone else was in control  You think it’s easier To give up on the trouble If the trouble is destroying you You think it’s easier But before you throw me a rope It was the one thing I could hold on to  I have a will for survival So you can hurt me And then hurt me some more I can live with denial But you’re not my troubles anymore  Somebody stepped inside your soul Somebody stepped inside your soul Little by little they robbed and stole Till someone else was in control  Somebody stepped inside your soul Somebody stepped inside your soul Little by little they robbed and stole Till someone else was in control  God knows it’s not easy Taking on the shape of someone else’s pain God now you can see me I’m naked and I’m not afraid My body’s sacred and I’m not ashamed  Somebody stepped inside your soul Somebody stepped inside your soul Little by little they robbed and stole Till someone else was in control  Somebody stepped inside your soul Somebody stepped inside your soul Little by little they robbed and stole Till someone else was in control  (This song features Lykke Li on co-lead vocals)   Lucifer's Hands"   Punk rock party in a suburban home Everybody’s famous here but nobody’s known We got no music ‘cause the speaker’s blown Apart  The spirit’s moving through a seaside town I’m born again to the latest sound New wave airwaves swirling around my heart  You no longer got a hold on me I’m out of Lucifer’s hands You no longer got a hold on me You’re no longer in control of me I am  The NME is spitting from an inky page St. John the Divine is gonna take the stage Like a talent show where your talent is your rage I’m in  Prayers of fire on a raindog night Young men see visions beyond sound or sight The Velvets beginning to see the light Amen  You no longer got a hold on me I’m out of Lucifer’s hands You no longer got a hold on me You’re no longer in control of me I am  Yes, I can change the world Yes, I can change the world The poor breaking bread That’s made out of stone The rich man won’t eat He’s eating alone That’s easy But I can’t change the world in me  You no longer got a hold on me I’m out of Lucifer’s hands You no longer got a hold on me You’re no longer in control of me I am "The Crystal Ballroom"   Life begins with the first glance The first kiss at the first dance All of us are wondering why we’re here In the crystal ballroom underneath the chandelier  Wet the glass ’til the glasses sing We punish our hearts ’til the heart bells ring‘Cause where we come from We’re not always kind The human story is what love leaves behind  We’re the ghosts of love And we haunt this place We’re the ghosts of love In every face In the ballroom of the crystalline Everyone’s here with me tonight Everyone but you  Our first chance is their last dance Our life is shaped by another’s hands Buttoning, unbuttoning her Coco dress Stopping and unstopping every cold caress  Born for bliss, born for this Every human life begins with a kiss Kissed by every kind of possibility And everyone is here tonight with me  We’re the ghosts of love And we haunt this place We’re the ghosts of love In every face In the ballroom of the crystalline Everyone’s here with me tonight  Everybody’s here with me tonight Everybody’s here with me but you Everybody’s here with me tonight Everybody’s here with me but

the world I’m on Wait a bit longer Somebody throw a line to me Some tell me what to say  Sleep Like A Baby Tonight" (Alternate Perspective Mix)  Wake In the morning when you wake up You won’t have much But you’ll have enough When you are weakest I’ll be strong enough for you  Dreams Yeah, the ones where you are fearless Can’t break what’s broken You are tearless Steal back your innocence That’s what they stole from you  You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight Not everything can be so black and white There are demons in the broad daylight But you can sleep like a baby tonight  Stop Where you stand right now Just stop Don’t think or look down at the drop The people staring from the street Don’t know what you’ve got  You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight No, not everything can be so black and white There are demons in the broad daylight But you can sleep like a baby tonight  Hope is where the door is When home is where the war is Where nobody can feel no one else’s pain  You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight Not everything can be so black and so white There are demons in the broad daylight You’ve got to sleep like a baby tonight Sleep like a baby tonight Where you stand Where you fall is where I kneel To take your heart back to where you can feel Like a child, a child Invisible"   It’s like the room just cleared of smoke I didn’t even want the heart you broke It’s yours to keep You just might need one  I finally found my real name I won’t be me when you see me again No, I won’t be my father’s son  I’m more than you know I’m more than you see here More than you let me be I’m more than you know A body in a soul You don’t see me but you will I am not invisible  That's right I'm leaving the invisible world I’m leaving the invisible world  I don’t dream, not as such I don’t even think about you that much Unless I start to think at all  All those frozen days And your frozen ways They melt away your face like snow  I’m more than you know I’m more than you see here I’m more than you let me be I’m more than you know A body in a soul You don’t see me but you will I am not invisible I am here  There is no them There is no them There’s only us There’s only us There is no them There’s only you And there’s only me There is no them There is no them There’s only us There’s only us There is no them There is no them There’s only you And there’s only me There is no them The Crystal Ballroom" (12  Life begins with the first glance The first kiss at the first dance All of us are wondering why we’re here In the crystal ballroom underneath the chandelier  Wet the glass ’til the glasses sing We punish our hearts ’til the heart bells ring‘Cause where we come from We’re not always kind The human story is what love leaves behind  We’re the ghosts of love And we haunt this place We’re the ghosts of love In every face In the ballroom of the crystal lights Everyone’s here with me tonight Everyone but you  Our first chance is their last dance Our life is shaped by another’s hands Buttoning, unbuttoning her Coco dress Stopping and unstopping every cold caress  Born for bliss, born for this Every human life begins with a kiss Kissed by every kind of possibility And everyone is here tonight with me  We’re the ghosts of love And we haunt this place We’re the ghosts of love In every face In the ballroom of the crystal lights Everyone’s here with me tonight  Everybody’s here with me tonight Everybody’s here with me but you Everybody’s here with me tonight Everybody’s here with me but you Everybody’s here with me tonight Everybody’s here with me but you Everybody’s here with me tonight Everybody’s here with me but you  Born for bliss, born for this Every human life begins with a kiss  We’re the ghosts of love And we haunt this place We’re the ghosts of love We’re the ghosts of love And we haunt this place We’re the ghosts of love We’re the ghosts of love And we haunt this place We’re the ghosts of love We’re the ghosts of love And we haunt this place We’re the ghosts of love In every face In the ballroom of the crystalline  Born for bliss, born for this Every human life begins with a kiss Born for bliss, born for this Every human life begins with a kiss Born for bliss, born for this Every human life begins with a kiss  Buttoning, unbuttoning a Coco dress  Born for bliss, born for this Every human life begins with a kiss
