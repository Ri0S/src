So-called "junk DNA" may turn out to be just as important as our much sought-after genes. As this ScienCentral News video reports, a new study of junk DNA could open up new areas of medical research. Trash Becomes Treasure There are so many scientists working to understand human disease genes, and mapping the genomes of different species, it might be surprising to learn that our genes only make up a small portion of our DNA. "Only a tiny fraction of [DNA] actually makes up what are conventionally thought of as genesâ€” little stretches of DNA that make protein," says David Haussler, director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering at the University of California at Santa Cruz. "Probably the fraction of the DNA that actually is genes in the traditional sense of making proteins is as little as 1.2 percent. The rest of the DNA is what people used to call "junk." All DNA gets passed down from parent to offspring, a process that's been going on for billions of years. "About four to five hundred million years ago, the common ancestor of fish, birds and mammals was a creature that lived in the ocean," explains Haussler, "and that creature passed on DNA to its offspring and they passed on the DNA to their offspring, and through the millions of years different species have evolved from a common ancestor."
