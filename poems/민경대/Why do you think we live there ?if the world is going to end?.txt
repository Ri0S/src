Why do you think we live there ?if the world is going to end?  We live here because of a plausible accident. Because life is statistical possibility and because the universe is almost infinite, it comes to be that an infinite number of possibilities at one point or another exist. Some cosmologists believe there is a statistical chance that we are just brains floating in space imagining a world that statistically we happen to inhabit...weird huh. Read the article below. I think the world stands a chance of ending any day, but that isn't to say I expect it. Frankly a giant star 2000 lights years away could have exploded 1999.99 light years ago and we might not see it, let alone feel its devastating effects, until next week. In my opinion value every year, season, month, week, day, hour, minute, and second. Life is fragile and we are lucky.4 hours ago Source(s):http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/scienc
