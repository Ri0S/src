care house The personal care home with a heart The House of Care is a small non-profit personal care home in State College PA dedicated to serving those with extremely low income, little to no family support and requiring assistance with activities of daily living. Our maximum occupancy is 5 residents. Our annual budget is $180,000. It costs at least $100/day/resident to pay for housing, meals and personal care services. Because of their low income, our residents can only pay an average of $29/day/resident. Thus, the House of Care must raise the other $71/day/resident through donations from community foundations, organizations and individuals.  You can support our mission today by clicking the blue button below.  Contact us at:House of Care515 W Beaver AveState College PA 16801Â  814-237-5517 phone814-237-8615 faxhouseofcare5@gmail.com   http://www.houseofcare.org/
