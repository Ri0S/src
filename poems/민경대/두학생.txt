두학생 두학생Unknown poet I wish to honor you as a great poet.exclaiming that your ancestorsWere royal descendants,Opening an encyclopedia inWhich your last name isl listedYour royal ancestors yearn to sleepIn the shadow of your eightiesBut this is no place to restWhere only anonymous dustIs the waiting bed.
