그저  아련한 메아리 속에 별 빛 그속에또 하나의 집은 조용한 침국을 지킨다   The Vikings Reconstructed Viking house, FyrkatArchaeological excavations in various parts of Denmark have revealed much about the way the Vikings lived. One of the most notable sites is Hedeby. Located some 45 km south of the Danish border near the German town of Schleswig, it probably dates back to the end of the 8th century. The houses are deemed to be among the most sophisticated dwellings of their time. Oak frames were used for the walls and the roofs were probably thatched.[1] Viking ring houses, such as those at Trelleborg, near Slagelse on the Danish island of Zealand, have a rather different, ship-like shape, the long walls bulging outwards. Each house consisted of a large central hall (18 x 8 m) and two smaller rooms, one at each end. Those at Fyrkat (c. 980) in the north of Jutland were 28.5 m long, 5 m wide at the ends and 7.5 m in the middle, the long walls curving slightly outwards. The walls consisted of double rows of posts with planks wedged horizontally between them. A series of outer posts slanted towards the wall were possibly used to support the building like buttresses.[2]
