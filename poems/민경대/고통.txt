고통  고통이 두드린다 문설주에 기대어 서서  Scars upon my body,marks that will never heal,blood flowing down from my wrist,i know that this pain is real,things i don't understand,like why is this knife in my hand,why is this pain taking control,why does it feel like i have no soul,why does my body seem so cold,and why do i keep this knife to hold,are all these questions showing me,the way i should go,i keep on thinking,in my head,what the scars have done to me,and now of this iam dead.
