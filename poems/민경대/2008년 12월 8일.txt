2008년 12월 8일  다시시작하는 날Life-Giving Leaf  I put the dead flowersInto a flower pot-tomb.On the windowsill.A new bud changing into an old one.Flutters lightly.My enraptured muddy is turning green.The tall leaves of the treesWith wings of life areSingingSingingNodding and shaking its boughs.
