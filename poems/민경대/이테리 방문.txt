이테리 방문  내년에 일주일 이테리 방문  First Annual Poets at Work Retreat, Tuscany, Italy  borgo2June 14 – 20, 2015, Lunigiana, Tuscany Il Borgo di Castiglione del Terziere Join master poets Elisa Biagini, Gerry LaFemina, and Paul Perry for a week of writing and poetry fellowship in the beautiful Lunigiana region of northern Tuscany.  Escape the ordinary in Castiglione del Terziere, a medieval village whose castle—meticulously restored by the late Loris Jacopo Bononi, a doctor and poet—contains an exceptional collection of Italian manuscripts, incunabula, and books of poetry, history, and law as well as art and furnishings, dating from the Renaissance. Developed to give you plenty of time and space to write while also offering you the feedback of peers and masters of the craft, the Poets @ Work Retreat will stimulate your writing and broaden your sense of craft. Stay in a villa in the borgo walls or at the local inn, visit the castle, enjoy fine food and wine, be galvanized by the beauty and history of the borgo and landscape, and work individually and in workshop with our master poets. 62099188825http://poetsatwork.org/poets-at-work-retreat/
