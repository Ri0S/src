WELTON ACADEMY HALLWAY - DAY A young boy, dressed in a school uniform and cap, fidgets as his motheradjusts his tie. 				MOTHER		Now remember, keep your shoulders back. A student opens up a case and removes a set of bagpipes. The youngboy and his brother line up for a photograph 				PHOTOGRAPHER		Okay, put your arm around your brother.		That's it. And breathe in. The young boy blinks as the flash goes off. 				PHOTOGRAPHR		Okay, one more. An old man lights a single candle. A teacher goes over the oldman's duties. 				TEACHER		Now just to review, you're going to		follow along the procession until you		get to the headmaster. At that point		he will indicate to you to light the		candles of the boys. 				MAN		All right boys, let's settle down. The various boys, including NEIL, KNOX, and CAMERON, line up holdingbanners. Ahead of them is the old man, followed by the boy with thebagpipes with the two youngest boys at the front. 				MAN		Banners up. The boys hoist the banners and the bagpipes begin to play loudly. Thesmall group marches out of the room and down a set of stairs into achurch. The pews are filled with students and parents while theteachers, all dressed in robes, are seated at the front of the churchbehind the headmaster. The boys break off to either side at the front of the church. Thebagpipes cease and the headmaster, MR. NOLAN, walks over to the oldman carrying the candle. 				MR NOLAN		Ladies and gentlemen, boys, the light		of knowledge. An organ begins to play as the old man goes forward with shaking handsto the young boys in the front pew. Each boy is holding a candle andhe bends over to light the first one. Each boy in turn lights thecandle of the boy next to him. 				MR NOLAN		One hundred years ago, in 1859, 41 boys sat in this		room and were asked the same question that greets		you at the start of each semester. Gentlemen, what		are the four pillars? All throughout the pews, uniformed boys rise to their feet. TODD, whois not wearing a uniform, is urged by his father to stand with them. 				BOYS		Tradition, honor, discipline, excellence. The boys quickly return to their seats. 				MR NOLAN		In her first year, Welton Academy graduated five		students. Last year we graduated fifty-one. And		more than seventy-five percent of those went on to		the Ivy League. This, this kind of accomplishment is		the result of fervent dedication to the principles taught		here. This is why you parents have been sending us		your sons. This is why we are the best preparatory		school in the United States. Mr. Nolan soaks up the applause from the audience. 				MR NOLAN		As you know, our beloved Mr. Portius of the English		department retired last term. You will have the		opportunity later to meet his replacement, Mr. John		Keating, himself a graduate of this school. And who,		for the past several years, has been teaching at the		highly regarded Chester School in London. The crowd applauds once again. EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY The school lawn is a filled with luggage, students, and parents mullingabout in every direction. INT CHURCH ENTRANCE - DAY Mr Nolan stands by the entrance, speaking with each family as they leave. 				MR NOLAN		Glad you could come by. 				MR ANDERSON		Thrilling ceremony as usual Dr. Nolan. 				MR NOLAN		You've been away too long. 				MRS ANDERSON		Hello Dr. Nolan. 				MR NOLAN		Good to have you back. 				MRS ANDERSON		This is our youngest, Todd. 				MR NOLAN		Mr. Anderson.You have some big shoes to fill,		young man. Your brother was one of our finest. 				TODD		Thank you. Todd and his parents leave while others file past Mr. Nolan. 				WOMAN		Lovely ceremony. 				MR NOLAN		Thank you. So glad you liked it. MR PERRY approaches with his son Neil. He shakes Mr. Nolan's hand. 				MR PERRY		Gale 				MR NOLAN		Tom 				MR PERRY		Good to see you again. 				NEIL		Hello Mr. Nolan. 				MR NOLAN		Neil. We expect great things from you this year. 				NEIL		Thank you, sir. 				MR PERRY		Well he won't disappoint us. Right Neil? 				NEIL		I'll do my best sir. EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY A bell tolls. Parents begin wishing their boys farewell. 				FATHER		Hey, come on son. 				MOTHER		Chin up. 				FATHER		No tears now. 				BOY		Okay. 				MOTHER		Chin up. Another boy hugs his mother. 				BOY		I don't want to go here. 				MOTHER		You be a good boy and do your lessons. EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY Neil emerges from a building and sees Todd. 				NEIL		Hey, I hear we're gonna be roommates. He shakes Todd's hand. 				NEIL		I'm Neil Perry. 				TODD		Todd Anderson. 				NEIL		Why'd you leave Balincrest? 				TODD		My brother went here. 				NEIL		Oh, so you're that Anderson. INT DORMATORY - DAY DR. HAGER is standing in his room doorway while SPAZ and his father aregoing over some last minute precautions over the boy's allergies. Spaz'sfather hands Hager various bottles. 				FATHER		This is for sinuses. Oh, and if he can't swallow you		give him one of these. And if he had trouble breathing		you can give him some of those. 				HAGER		All right fine. Dr. Hager takes the bottles and quickly backs into his room, shuttingthe door. 				FATHER			    (to son)		Did you remember your vaporizer? 				SPAZ		Yes, I put it in my room. Spaz's father tries to say something else to Dr. Hager but realizes hehas already gone. INT HALLWAY - DAY Neil pushes his way through a crowd of boys, carrying two suitcases. Ashe enters his room, Knox quickly passes by. 				KNOX		Hey, how's it going Neil? 				NEIL		Hey Knox. Cameron comes by and leans against the doorway. 				CAMERON		Neil, study group tonight? 				NEIL		Yeah, sure. 				CAMERON		Business as usual, huh? Hey, I hear you got the new		kid. Looks like a stiff! He begins laughing when he notices Todd coming into the room. 				CAMERON		Oops! Cameron quickly leaves. Neil tries to keep from laughing as Todd entersthe room and sets his luggage down on his bed. 				NEIL		Listen, don't mind Cameron. He was born with his		foot in his mouth. You know what I mean? He pulls some papers from his blazer pocket and playfully whacks Todd across the back with it. CHARLIE comes to the door with a smug expression on his face. Knox andMEEKS are close behind him. He points at Neil 				CHARLIE		Rumor has it, you did summer school. 				NEIL		Yep. Chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead.		How was your summer Slick? 				CHARLIE		Keen. The boys enter the room. Charlie turns around and looks at Meeks who isjust entering.  				CHARLIE		Meeks. Door. Closed. 				MEEKS		Yes sir. 				NEIL		Gentlemen, what are the four pillars? 				BOYS		Travesty. Horror. Decadence. Excrement. Charlie makes himself comfortable on Neil's bed and lights up a cigarette.Meanwhile, Todd is by his bed unpacking his luggage. 				CHARLIE		Okay, study group. Meeks aced Latin. I didn't quite		flunk English. So, if you want, we've got our study		group. 				NEIL		Sure. Cameron asked me too. Anyone mind		including him? 				CHARLIE		Hmm, what's his specialty, boot-licking? 				NEIL		Come on, he's your roommate. 				CHARLIE		That's not my fault. Meeks seems to notice Todd for the first time. 				MEEKS		Oh, I'm sorry, my name is Steven Meeks. Neil quickly gets up from his spot by the window. 				NEIL		Oh, this is Todd Anderson. Todd turns around and shakes hands with Meeks. 				MEEKS		Nice to meet you. 				TODD		Nice to meet you. 				CHARLIE		Charlie Dalton. Charlie continues to lay on the bed, looking smug. Knox extends a hand. 				KNOX		Knox Overstreet. 				NEIL		Todd's brother was Jeffrey Anderson. 				CHARLIE		Oh yeah, sure. Valedictorian. National merit scholar.  				MEEKS		Oh well, welcome to Hell-ton. 				CHARLIE		It's every bit as tough as they say, unless you're a		genius like Meeks. 				MEEKS		He flatters me. That's why I help him with Latin. 				CHARLIE		And English, and Trig. Charlie begins coughing. There is a knock at the door. Charlie quicklystamps out his cigarette on the floor and Neil tries to wave the smokefrom the air. 				NEIL		It's open. The door opens and Mr. Perry walks into the room. Neil quickly rises fromthe window. 				NEIL		Father, I thought you'd gone. The other boys stand up when he enters. 				BOYS		Mr. Perry. 				MR PERRY		Keep your seats fellows, keep your seats. Neil, I've		just spoken to Mr. Nolan. I think that you're taking		too many extra curricular activities this semester, and		I've decided that you should drop the school annual. 				NEIL		But I'm the assistant editor this year. 				MR PERRY		Well I'm sorry Neil. 				NEIL		But Father, I can't. It wouldn't be fair. 				MR PERRY		Fellas, would you excuse us for a moment? Mr. Perry walks towards the door and Neil hesitantly follows. Mr. Perrypauses by the door and smiles to the other boys. INT. HALLWAY - DAY The smile has gone from Mr. Perry's face. He grabs a hold of Neil's arm. 				MR PERRY		Don't you ever dispute me in public. Do you		understand? 				NEIL		Father, I wasn't disputing- 				MR PERRYAfter you've finished medical school and you're on your own, then youcan do as you damn well please. But until then, you do as I tell you.Is that clear? 				NEIL		Yes sir. I'm sorry. 				MR PERRY		You know how much this means to your mother,		don't you? 				NEIL		Yes sir. You know me, always taking on too much. 				MR PERRY		Well, that's my boy. Now listen, you need anything,		you let us know, huh? 				NEIL		Yes sir. Mr. Perry slaps his son on the shoulder and leaves. Neil leans his headback against the wall as the other boys emerge from the room. 				CHARLIE		Why doesn't he let you do what you want? 				KNOX		Yeah Neil, tell him off. It couldn't get any worse. 				NEIL		Oh, that's rich. Like you guys tell your parents off, Mr.		Future Lawyer and Mr. Future Banker. 				CHARLIE		Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do. 				NEIL		Well just don't tell me how to talk to my father. You		guys are the same way. 				KNOX		All right, all right, Jesus. So what are you going to do? 				NEIL		What I have to do. Drop the annual. 				CHARLIE		Well I wouldn't lose much sleep over it. It's just a		bunch of jerks trying to impress Nolan. 				NEIL		I don't care. I don't give a damn about any of it. 				MEEKS		Well, uh, Latin, eight o' clock in my room? 				NEIL		Yes. 				MEEKS		Todd, you're welcome to join us. 				KNOX		Yeah, come along pal. Todd looks up from his desk where he is setting his alarm clock. 				TODD		Thanks. EXT. FIELDS - DAY A clock bell chimes five o'clock. Enormous flocks of birds, apparentlydisturbed by the noise, take to the sky. INT. STAIRCASE - DAY The sound of squawking birds merges into the sound of noisy boys as theydescend the stairs in a long spiralling line. MR. MCALLISTER tries to make it upstairs against the steady stream. 				MCALLISTER		Slow down boys, slow down you horrible		phalanx of pubescense. INT CHEMISTRY LAB - DAY A teacher walks up and down the aisles, handing out books. 				TEACHER		Pick three laboratory experiments from		the project list and report on them every		five weeks. The first twenty questions at		the end of chapter one are due tomorrow. The students let out a collective groan. INT. LATIN CLASSROOM - DAY Mr. McAllister paces back and forth in front of the blackboard and getsthe students to repeat everything he says. 				MCALLISTER			    (students repeat after each word.)		Agricolam. Agricola. Agricolae.		Agricolarum. Agricolis. Agricolas.		Agrilcolis. 		Again, please.		Agricola. INT. MATH CLASSROOM - DAY Dr. Hager walks up the classroom aisles with his arms behind his back. 				HAGER		Your study of trigonometry requires absolute precision.		Anyone failing to turn in any homework assignment will		be penalized one point off their final grade. Let me urge		you now not to test me on this point. INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY Students enter Keating's classroom, talking and acting up. Keatingglances out from his room off to one side. 				KNOX		Hey Spaz, Spaz. Spaz turns around in time to be hit by a ball of crumpled up paperwhile Cameron smacks him on the shoulder. 				CAMERON		Brain damage. The students quickly quiet down as Keating emerges from the other room,whistling the 1812 Overture. He walks up the length of the classroom andout the door without a word. The students look around at one another,uncertain of what to do. Keating pokes his head back in the doorway. 				KEATING		Well come on. He gestures them to follow and the students, after some hesitation, grabtheir books and follow Keating out into the main entranceway.  INT. ENTRANCEWAY - DAY Keating stands before the school's trophy cabinets and waits until allthe boys arrive. 				KEATING		"Oh Captain, My Captain" who knows where		that comes from? Todd looks up as if he knows the answer, but says nothing. Spaz blows hisnose a little too close to Meeks for his liking. 				KEATING		Not a clue? It's from a poem by Walt		Whitman about Mr. Abraham Lincoln. Now in		this class you can call me Mr. Keating. Or,		if you're slightly more daring, Oh Captain,		My Captain. The students laugh slightly. 				KEATING		Now let me dispel a few rumors so they		don't fester into facts. Yes, I too		attended Hell-ton and survived. And no,		at that time I was not the mental giant		you see before you. I was the intellectual		equivalent of a ninety-eight pound		weakling. I would go to the beach and		people would kick copies of Byron in my		face. The boys laugh once again, while Cameron, obviously trying to write allthis down, looks around confusedly. Keating looks down at papers in hishand. 				KEATING		Now, Mr� Pitts. That's a rather		unfortunate name. Mr. Pitts, where are		you? Pitts raises his hand while everyone around him snickers. 				KEATINGMr. Pitts, would you open your hymnal to page 542 and read the firststanza of the poem you find there? 				PITTS		"To the virgins, to make much of time"? 				KEATING		Yes, that's the one. Somewhat appropriate,		isn't it. 				PITTS		"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old		time is still a flying, and this same		flower that smiles today, tomorrow will		be dying." 				KEATING		Thank you Mr. Pitts. "Gather ye rosebuds		while ye may." The Latin term for that		sentiment is Carpe Diem. Now who knows		what that means? Meeks immediately puts his hand up. 				MEEKS		Carpe Diem. That's "seize the day." 				KEATING		Very good, Mr.- 				MEEKS		Meeks. 				KEATING		Meeks. Another unusual name. Seize the		day. Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.		Why does the writer use these lines? 				CHARLIE		Because he's in a hurry. 				KEATING		No, ding! Keating slams his hand down on an imaginary buzzer. 				KEATING		Thank you for playing anyway. Because we		are food for worms lads. Because, believe		it or not, each and every one of us in		this room is one day going to stop		breathing, turn cold, and die.  Keating turns towards the trophy cases, filled with trophies, footballs,and team pictures. 				KEATING		Now I would like you to step forward over		here and peruse some of the faces from		the past. You've walked past them many		times. I don't think you've really looked		at them. The students slowly gather round the cases and Keating moves behind them. 				KEATING		They're not that different from you, are		they? Same haircuts. Full of hormones,		just like you. Invincible, just like you		feel. The world is their oyster. They		believe they're destined for great things,		just like many of you. Their eyes are full		of hope, just like you. Did they wait until		it was too late to make from their lives		even one iota of what they were capable?		Because you see gentlmen, these boys are		now fertilizing daffodils. But if you listen		real close, you can hear them whisper their		legacy to you. Go on, lean in. The boys lean in and Keating hovers over Cameron's shoulder. 				KEATING			    (whispering in a gruff voice)		Carpe. Cameron looks over his shoulder with an aggravated expression on his face.  				KEATING		Hear it?			    (whispering again)		Carpe. Carpe Diem. Seize the day boys,		make your lives extraordinary. The boys stare at the faces in the cabinet in silence. EXT. SCHOOL STEPS - DAY The boys emerge from the school, loaded down with numerous books. 				PITTS		That was weird. 				NEIL		But different. 				KNOX		Spooky if you ask me. 				CAMERON		Think he'll test us on that stuff? 				CHARLIE		Come on Cameron, don't you get anything? 				CAMERON		What? What? INT. LOCKER ROOM - EVENING A coach sticks his head around the corner into the room. 				COACH		Let's go boys, hustle up in here. That		means you Dalton. Meeks emerges from the showers, drying himself off. 				MEEKS		Okay, who's up for a trig study group		tonight guys? 				PITTS		Me. 				NEIL		Me. 				CHARLIE			(still annoyed by what the coach said)		What? 				KNOX		I can't make it guys. I have to have		dinner at the Danburry's house. 				PITTS		The Danburry's? Who are the Danburry's? 				CAMERON		Big alumns. How'd you swing that? 				KNOX		Friends of my Dad's. They're probably in		their nineties or something. 				CHARLIE		Ooh! 				NEIL		Anything's better than Hell-ton hash. 				CHARLIE		I'll second that. 				KNOX		Yeah we'll see. Neil approaches Todd, who's been sitting by the window staring down at thefloor. Neil snaps his fingers to get Todd's attention.  				NEIL		Hey, you coming to the study group tonight? 				TODD		Uh, no, no I, uh, I've got some history I		wanna do. 				NEIL		Suit yourself. INT. TODD'S ROOM - EVENING Todd is seated at his desk. He scrawls "CARPE DIEM" across a blank pageof his notebook. He looks at it for a few moments before crumpling it upand opening up his Chemistry book. INT. ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT Hager comes down the stairs. Knox is looking at one of the old class photoson the walls. 				HAGER		Ready Overstreet? Knox reluctantly follows after Dr. Hager. 				KNOX		Ready to go sir. EXT. ROAD - NIGHT The car leaves Welton and drives towards the Danburry's house. INT / EXT DANBURRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT The doorbell rings. 				MRS DANBURRY (O.S.)		Chet, can you get that? 				CHET (O.S.)		I can't, Mom. 				CHRIS (O.S.)		I'll get it. The door opens and Knox is awe-struck by the beautiful girl (CHRIS) whohas answered the door. 				CHRIS		Can I help you? Knox manages to break out of his daze. 				KNOX		Hi. Knox Overstreet. Uh, Dr. Hager. 				CHRIS		Hi. 				KNOX		This is the Danburry's, right? 				CHRIS		Are you here to see Chet? 				KNOX		Mrs. Danburry? Chris begins to laugh as Mrs. Danburry arrives behind her. 				CHRIS		No. 				MRS DANBURRY		Sorry. Thank you Chris. I'm Mrs. Danburry.		You must be Knox. 				KNOX		Yes. 				MRS DANBURRY			    (to Dr. Hager)		Back by nine.			    (to Knox)		Please come in. 				CHET (O.S.)		Chris, come on, what are you doing? 				CHRIS		Chet, I'm coming. Knox enters the house, his mind still hung up on Chris as MR DANBURRYcomes out of the living room to meet him. 				MR DANBURRY		Knox. How are you? Joe Danburry. 				KNOX		Nice to meet you sir. 				MR DANBURRY		Well he's the spitting image of his father,		isn't he. How is he? Come on in. 				CHET (O.S.)		Chris! 				KNOX		He's great. He just did a big case for GM. 				CHRIS (O.S.)		I'm coming. 				MR DANBURRY		I know where you're headed, like father		like son, huh? INT. STUDENT LOUNGE - NIGHT Several students are throwing darts at a small rubber skeleton hangingfrom the bulletin board. Various students are studying and playing games.Meeks and Pitts are sitting at one table working on their "hi-fi system".Meeks is waving an antenna around with no luck. Pitts points out to himthat he forgot to plug it in. Neil, Cameron, and Charlie are working ontheir trig homework. 				CAMERON		Just replace these numbers here with "x",		for "x" and "y". 				NEIL		Of course. 				CAMERON		Of course, so what's the problem? Charlie enters the room and closes the door behind him, leaning upagainst it heavily. 				CHARLIE		How was dinner? 				KNOX		Huh? 				CHARLIE		How was dinner? 				KNOX		Terrible. Awful. He leaves the door and sits down with the other boys. 				CHARLIE		Why? What happened? 				KNOX		Tonight, I met the most beautiful girl		in my entire life. 				NEIL		Are you crazy? What's wrong with that? 				KNOX		She's practically engaged. To Chet Danburry. 				CHARLIE		That guy could eat a football. 				PITTS		That's too bad. 				KNOX		Too bad? It's worse than too bad Pitsie,		it's a tragedy. A girl this beautiful in		love with such a jerk. 				PITTS		All the good ones go for jerks, you		know that. 				CAMERON		Ahh, forget her. Open your trig book and		try and figure out problem five. 				KNOX		I can't just forget her Cameron. And I		can't think about trig. The radio Meeks and Pitts were working on begins letting out a highpitched hum. 				PITTS		We got it. 				MEEKS		Holy cow. Mr. Hager walks into the room. 				HAGER		All right gentlemen, five minutes. Let's		go. The students quickly pack up their gear and prepare to leave. Pitts triesto hide the radio in his lap. Charlie leans in close to Knox. 				CHARLIE		Did you see her naked? 				KNOX		Very funny Dalton. 				HAGER		That wouldn't be a radio in your lap,		would it Mr. Pitts? 				PITTS		No sir. Science experiment, radar. Meeks holds up the antenna as if demonstrating it. INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY Keating sits at his desk at the front of the classroom and opens up oneof his books. 				KEATING		Gentlemen, open your text to page		twenty-one of the introduction. Mr.		Perry, will you read the opening		paragraph of the preface, entitled		"Understanding Poetry"? 				NEIL		Understanding Poetry, by Dr. J. Evans		Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand		poetry, we must first be fluent with		its meter, rhyme, and figures of speech.		Then ask two questions: One, how artfully		has the objective of the poem been		rendered, and two, how important is that		objective. Question one rates the poem's		perfection, question two rates its		importance. And once these questions have		been answered, determining a poem's		greatest becomes a relatively simple		matter. Keating gets up from his desk and prepares to draw on the chalk board. 				NEIL		If the poem's score for perfection is		plotted along the horizontal of a graph,		and its importance is plotted on the		vertical, then calculating the total		area of the poem yields the measure of		its greatness. Keating draws a corresponding graph on the board and the studentsdutifully copy it down. 				NEIL		A sonnet by Byron may score high on the		vertical, but only average on the		horizontal. A Shakespearean sonnet, on		the other hand, would score high both		horizontally and vertically, yielding a		massive total area, thereby revealing the		poem to be truly great. As you proceed		through the poetry in this book, practice		this rating method. As your ability to		evaluate poems in this matter grows, so		will - so will your enjoyment and		understanding of poetry. Neil sets the book down and takes off his glasses. The student sittingacross from him is discretely trying to eat. Keating turns away fromthe chalkboard with a smile. 				KEATING		Excrement. That's what I think of Mr. J.		Evans Pritchard. We're not laying pipe,		we're talking about poetry. Cameron looks down at the graph he copied into his notes and quicklyscribbles it out. 				KEATING		I mean, how can you describe poetry like		American Bandstand? I like Byron, I give		him a 42, but I can't dance to it. Charlie suddenly appear to become interested in the class. 				KEATING		Now I want you to rip out that page. The students look at Keating as if he has just gone mad. 				KEATING		Go on, rip out the entire page. You heard		me, rip it out. Rip it out! Charlie looks around at the others. He then looks down at his own notes,which consists of drawing breasts. 				KEATING		Go on, rip it out. Charlie rips the page out and holds it up. 				KEATING		Thank you Mr. Dalton. Gentlemen, tell you		what, don't just tear out that page, tear		out the entire introduction. I want it		gone, history. Leave nothing of it. Rip		it out. Rip! Begone J. Evans Pritchard,		Ph.D. Rip, shred, tear. Rip it out. I		want to hear nothing but ripping of Mr.		Pritchard. Meeks looks around reluctantly and then finally begins tearing out pages. 				KEATING		We'll perforate it, put it on a roll. Keating sees Cameron still hesitating. 				KEATING		It's not the bible, you're not going to		go to hell for this. Go on, make a clean		tear, I want nothing left of it. Keating goes over to his room. Cameron turns around to Neil. 				CAMERON		We shouldn't be doing this. 				NEIL		Rip, rip, rip! Neil makes Cameron turn back around. 				KEATING (O.S.)		Rip it out, rip! From outside the classroom, Mr. McAllister hears all the noise and seesall the students ripping out the pages. He bursts into the room. 				MCALLISTER		What the hell is going on here? The boys all turn around in shock. Charlie stuffs a crumpled page into hismouth. Keating emerges from his room with a waste paper basket. 				KEATING		I don't hear enough rips. 				MCALLISTER		Mr. Keating. 				KEATING		Mr. McAllister. 				MCALLISTER		I'm sorry, I- I didn't know you were		here. 				KEATING		I am. 				MCALLISTER		Ahh, so you are. Excuse me. Mr. McAllister slowly backs out of the classroom. 				KEATING		Keep ripping gentlemen. This is a battle,		a war. And the casualties could be your		hearts and souls.  Keating holds out the basket to Charlie who spits out a wad of paper. 				KEATING		Thank you Mr. Dalton. Armies of academics		going forward, measuring poetry. No, we		will not have that here. No more of Mr.		J. Evans Pritchard. Now in my class you		will learn to think for yourselves again.		You will learn to savor words and language.		No matter what anybody tells you, words and		ideas can change the world. I see that look		in Mr. Pitt's eye, like nineteenth century		literature has nothing to do with going to		business school or medical school. Right?		Maybe. Mr. Hopkins, you may agree with him, 		thinking "Yes, we should simply study our		Mr. Pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter		and go quietly about the business of		achieving other ambitions." I have a little		secret for ya. Huddle up. Huddle up!  The boys get up from their seats and gather around Keating in the centerof the class. 				KEATING		We don't read and write poetry because		it's cute. We read and write poetry		because we are members of the human race.		And the human race is filled with passion.		Medicine, law, business, engineering,		these are all noble pursuits, and necessary		to sustain life. But poetry, beauty,		romance, love, these are what we stay alive		for. To quote from Whitman: "O me, o life		of the questions of these recurring, of the		endless trains of the faithless, of cities		filled with the foolish. What good amid		these, o me, o life? Answer: that you are		here. That life exists, and identity.		That the powerful play goes on, and you		may contribute a verse. That the powerful		play goes on and you may contribute a verse. Keating looks up at Todd. 				Keating		What will your verse be? INT. HEAD OF CAFETERIA - DAY The cafeteria is filled with students and teachers standing before the tables saying grace. 				ALL		For what we are about to receive, may the		Lord make us truly grateful. Amen. Mr. Keating and Mr. McAllister are seated next to one another at the table. 				MCALLISTER		Quite an interesting class you gave today,		Mr. Keating. 				KEATING		I'm sorry if I shocked you, Mr. McAllister. 				MCALLISTER		Oh, there's no need to apologize. It was		very fascinating, misguided though it was. 				KEATING		You think so? 				MCALLISTER		You take a big risk by encouraging them to		be artists John. When they realize they're		not Rembrandts, Shakespeares or Mozarts,		they'll hate you for it. 				KEATING		We're not talking artists George, we're		talking free thinkers. 				MCALLISTER		Free thinkers at seventeen? 				KEATING		Funny, I never pegged you as a cynic. 				MCALLISTER			  (taken aback by the comment)		Not a cynic, a realist. Show me the heart		unfettered by foolish dreams, and I'll		show you a happy man. 				KEATING		But only in their dreams can man be truly		free. 'Twas always thus, and always thus		will be. 				MCALLISTER		Tennyson? 				KEATING		No, Keating. Keating winks and Mr. McAllister can't help but laugh. INT. CAFETERIA TABLE - DAY Neil joins the others at the table. He pulls out a yearbook. 				NEIL		Hey, I found his senior annual in the		library. He hands the annual over to Cameron who laughs at the younger picture of Keating. 				NEIL		Listen to this, captain of the soccer team,		editor of the school annual, Cambridge		bound, Thigh man, and the Dead Poets Society. 				CAMERON			    (reading from the annual)		Man most likely to do anything. 				CHARLIE		Thigh man. Mr. K was a hell-raiser. 				KNOX		What's the Dead Poets Society? 				NEIL		I don't know. 				MEEKS		Is there a picture in the annual? 				NEIL		Nothing. No other mention of it. 				MR. NOLAN (O.S.)		That boy there, see me after lunch. Cameron quickly puts the annual away and the others all return to their meal. EXT. WELTON GROUNDS - DAY Keating is walking down towards the lake, whistling the same tune as before.The boys emerge from the building and chase after him. 				NEIL		Mr. Keating? Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain,		My Captain? Keating immediately turns around. 				KEATING		Gentlemen. 				NEIL		We were just looking in your old annual. He hands Keating the annual and Keating looks at his old photograph. 				KEATING		Oh my God. No, that's not me. Stanley		"The Tool" Wilson- Keating crouches down and continues looking through the book. 				KEATING		God. Neil crouches down next to Keating. 				NEIL		What was the Dead Poets Society? 				KEATING		I doubt the present administration would		look too favorably upon that. 				NEIL		Why? What was it? 				KEATING		Gentlemen, can you keep a secret? 				NEIL		Sure. The other boys crouch down around Keating. 				KEATING		The Dead Poets were dedicated to sucking		the marrow out of life. That's a phrase		from Thoreau that we'd invoke at the		beginning of each meeting. You see we'd		gather at the old Indian cave and take		turns reading from Thoreau, Whitman,		Shelley; the biggies. Even some of our		own verse. And in the enchantment of the		moment we'd let poetry work its magic. 				KNOX		You mean it was a bunch of guys sitting		around reading poetry? 				KEATING		No Mr. Overstreet, it wasn't just "guys",		we weren't a Greek organization, we were		romantics. We didn't just read poetry,		we let it drip from our tongues like honey.		Spirits soared, women swooned, and gods		were created, gentlemen, not a bad way to		spend an evening eh? Thank you Mr. Perry		for this trip down amnesia lane. Burn that,		especially my picture. Keating hands the annual back and walks away, whistling once again. Neilremains crouched. 				NEIL		Dead Poets Society. 				CAMERON		What? The school bells begin ringing and everyone heads back towards the school.Neil stands up. 				NEIL		I say we go tonight. 				CHARLIE		Tonight? 				CAMERON		Wait a minute. 				PITTS		Where's this cave he's talking about? 				NEIL		It's beyond the stream. I know where it		is. 				PITTS		That's miles. 				CAMERON		Sounds boring to me. 				CHARLIE		Don't go. 				CAMERON		You know how many de-merits we're talking		Dalton 				CHARLIE		So don't come, please. 				CAMERON		Look, all I'm saying is that we have to		be careful, we can't get caught. 				CHARLIE		No shit, Sherlock. 				HAGER				(yelling)		You boys there, hurry up. Neil turns around and faces the other boys. 				NEIL		All right, who's in? 				CAMERON		Come on Neil, Hager's right- 				NEIL		Forget Hager, no. Who's in? 				CHARLIE		I'm in. 				HAGER (O.S.)		I'm warning you, move. 				CAMERON		Me too. 				PITTS		I don't know Neil 				NEIL		What? Pitts- 				CHARLIE		Pitsie, come on. 				MEEKS		His grades are hurting Charlie. 				NEIL		You can help him Meeks. 				PITTS		What is this, a midnight study group? 				NEIL		Forget it Pitts, you're coming. Meeks,		are your grades hurting too? 				MEEKS		I'll try anything once. 				CHARLIE		Except sex. 				MEEKS		Ha ha ha. 				CAMERON		I mean as long as we're careful. The boys run into the building. 				CHARLIE		What about you Knox? 				KNOX		I don't know Charlie. 				CHARLIE		Come on Knox, it'll help you get Chris. 				KNOX		Yeah? How? 				CHARLIE		Women swoon. Charlie laughs and runs inside. Knox chases after him. 				KNOX		But why do they swoon? Charlie, tell me		why they swoon. Charlie! INT LIBRARY - DAY The boys are all gathered around one of the tables with a map laid outon it. 				NEIL			    (whispering)		Okay, follow the stream to the waterfall.		It's right there. It's got to be on the		banks. 				CAMERON		I don't know, it's starting to sound		dangerous. 				CHARLIE		Well, why don't you stay home? 				MCALLISTER		For God's sake stop chattering and		sit down. The boys take their seats once again and Neil goes over and sits next toTodd, who is sitting by himself. 				NEIL		Todd, are you coming tonight? 				TODD		No. 				NEIL		Why not? God, you were there. You heard		Keating. Don't you want to do something		about it? 				TODD		Yes, but- 				NEIL		But? But what? 				TODD		Keating said that everybody took turns		reading and I don't want to do that. 				NEIL		Gosh, you really have a problem with		that, don't you? 				TODD		N- no, I don't have a problem. Neil,		I just- I just don't want to do it,		okay? 				NEIL		All right. What if you didn't have to		read? What if you just came and		listened? 				TODD		That's not how it works. 				NEIL		Forget how it works. What if - what if		they said it was okay? 				TODD		What? What are you gonna do, go up and		ask them? Neil shrugs. 				TODD		No. No, Neil. 				NEIL		I'll be right back. 				TODD		Neil, Neil! Neil gets up and rejoins the others. McAllister hears the boys whisperingagain. 				MCALLISTER		Oh shut up, will you. INT BATHROOM - NIGHT Various boys are crowded around the sinks getting ready for bed. Someoneis playing snake charmer music on a kazoo while someone else is botheringSpaz with a red sock puppet acting like a snake. 				SPAZ		That's my- that's for my asthma, okay.		Could you give that back please? Could		you give that back? 				BOY		What's the matter? Don't you like snakes? Neil enters and taps Todd on the shoulder. 				NEIL		You're in. 				SPAZ		Get away from me, okay? 				BOY		Spaz, why don't you check your pocket,		huh? Come on Spaz I have to brush my		teeth 				SPAZ		Get a- get off,  Hager walks past the bathroom and into his room. 				HAGER		Cut out that racket in there. The kazoo player lets out a rude squeek before finally stopping. Hagerglares at them for a moment. INT NEIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Neil stands in his doorway. He looks across the hall to the other roomwhere Cameron and Charlie are standing. Cameron gives a thumbs up. Neilcloses his room door and takes out his cloak and a flashlight. Settingthe flashlight down on the desk, he notices a worn book, "FiveCenturies of Verse", sitting there. Opening it up, he sees John Keating'sname at the top followed by "Dead Poets". Below the title of the book,is written: "To Be Read At The Opening of D.P.S. Meetings." Along withseveral lines from Thoreau, beginning with "I went to the woods becauseI wanted to live deliberately�" INT STAIRWAY - NIGHT The shadows of hooded figures can be seen moving throughout the darkenedhalls. INT HAGER'S ROOM - NIGHT Hager hears a dog barking. INT HALLWAY - NIGHT Someone drops a number of dog biscuits by the dog's feet. He stopsbarking and immediately begins gobbling them down. Hager looks outinto the hallway with his flashlight but sees nothing. EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - NIGHT The boys quietly leave the building and set off running across thefields towards the woods. EXT WOODS - NIGHT The boys search about the trees trying to find the cave. Meeks issearching around when Charlie leaps up behind Meeks in the darkshining the flashlight up at his own face and grabs Meeks by theshoulder. 				CHARLIE		Arrr, I'm a dead poet. 				MEEKS		Aww, Charlie. 				CHARLIE			    (laughing)		Guys, over here. 				MEEKS		You're funny. You're real funny. INT CAVE - NIGHT The boys are trying to start a fire. The cave is quickly filling up withsmoke. 				MEEKS		It's too wet. CHARLIE		God, are you trying to smoke us out of		here? 				MEEKS		No, no, the smoke's going right up this		opening. Pitts tries to stand up and slams his head into the low rock ceiling. Helets out a yell while the others laugh. 				NEIL		You okay? 				PITTS		Oh God. Clowns. 				NEIL		All right, all right, forget the fire.		Let's go gentlemen. Neil stands before the others with the book in hand, and takes a dragon a cigarette. 				NEIL		I hereby reconvene the Dead Poets		Society. The boys cheer. 				NEIL		Welton chapter. The meetings will be		conducted by myself and the other new		initiates now present. Todd Anderson,		because he prefers not to read, will		keep minutes of the meetings. I'll now		read the traditional opening message by		society member Henry David Thoreau. "I		went to the woods because I wanted to		live deliberately. I wanted to live deep		and suck out all the marrow of life." 				CHARLIE		I'll second that. 				NEIL		"To put to rout all that was not life,		and not, when I had come to die,		discover that I had not lived. Several boys whistle softly in reaction to the poem. 				NEIL		And Keating's marked a bunch of other		pages. Neil begins flipping through the book. 				CHARLIE		All right, intermission. Dig deep right		here. Right here, lay it down 				CAMERON		On the mud? We're gonna put our food on		the mud? 				CHARLIE		Meeks, put your coat down. Picnic blanket. 				MEEKS		Yes sir, use Meeks' coat. 				CHARLIE		Don't keep anything back either. You		guys are always bumming my smokes. Meeks lays his coat down and everyone dumps their food on it. Amongstthe pile are chocolate chip cookies, a box of raisins, a few apples, anorange, and half a roll. 				NEIL		Raisins? 				KNOX		Yuck. 				CHARLIE		Wait a minute, who gave us half a roll? 				PITTS			  (talking with his mouth full)		I'm eating the other half. 				CHARLIE		Come on. 				PITTS		You want me to put it back? INT CAVE - NIGHT Neil, lit up by a flashlight, begins to tell everyone a story. 				NEIL		It was a dark and rainy night, and this		old lady, who had a passion for jigsaw		puzzles, sat by herself in her house at		her table to complete a new jigsaw puzzle.		But as she pieced the puzzle together, she		realized, to her astonishment, that the		image that was formed was her very own		room. And the figure in the center of the		puzzle, as she completed it, was herself.		And with trembling hands, she placed the		last four pieces and stared in horror at		the face of a demented madman at the		window. The last thing that this old lady		ever heard was the sound of breaking glass. 				BOYS		Ohhh� no� 				NEIL		This is true, this is true. 				CAMERON		I've got one that's even better than		that. 				CHARLIE		Ha! 				CAMERON		I do. There's a young, married couple,		and they're driving through the forest		at night on a long trip. And they run		out of gas, and there's a madman on the- 				CHARLIE		The thing with the hand- All the boys react, recalling the story and miming the scraping on theroof of the car. 				CAMERON		I love that story. 				CHARLIE		I told you that one. 				CAMERON		You did not. I got that in camp in		sixth grade. 				CHARLIE		When were you in six, last year? As everyone's voices begin to calm down, Pitts begins reading from thebook. 				PITTS		"In a mean abode in the shanking road,		lived a man named William Bloat. Now,		he had a wife, the plague of his life,		who continually got his goat. And one		day at dawn, with her nightshift on,		he slit her bloody throat." The boys laugh. 				PITTS		Oh, and it gets worse. 				CHARLIE		You want to hear a real poem? Meeks hands Charlie the book but he shoves it away. 				CHARLIE		All right? No, I don't need it. You take 		it.  				MEEKS		What, did you bring one?  				NEIL		You memorized a poem?  				CHARLIE		I didn't memorize a poem. Move up. Neil moves to the side as Charlie stands and takes his spot. 				MEEKS		An original piece by Charlie Dalton.  				KNOX		An original piece.  				PITTS		Take center stage.  				NEIL		You know this is history. Right? This is 		history. Charlie clears his throat and pulls out a page from a magazine and slowly unfolds it, revealing a Playboy centerfold (Elaine Reynolds,Miss October, 1959) 				MEEKS		Oh, wow.  				CAMERON		Where did you get that?  				CHARLIE 		Teach me to love? Go teach thyself more 		wit.		I, chief professor, am of it. Neil gets up and looks over Charlie's shoulder to see what he isreading. 				CHARLIE		The god of love, if such a thing there 		be, may learn to love from me. Charlie winks at the guys and they clap and cheer. 				NEIL		Wow! Did you write that? Charlie turns over the centerfold to show where he had written downthe poem. 				CHARLIE		Abraham Cowley. Okay, who's next?  Neil sits reading from the book by flashlight. 				NEIL		Alfred Lord Tennyson. 		Come my friends, 		'Tis not too late to seek a newer world 		for my purpose holds to sail beyond the 		sunset. 		And though we are not now that strength 		which in old days 		Moved earth and heaven; that which we 		are, we are;-- 		One equal temper of heroic hearts, 		Made weak by time and fate, but strong 		in will. 		To strive, to seek, to find, and not to 		yield.  Meeks takes center stage and begins reading a poem like he is performing a chant. 				MEEKS		Then I had religion, then I had a 		vision. 		I could not turn from their revel in 		derision. 		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 		the black, 		cutting through the forest with a golden 		track. 		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 		the black-  				CHARLIE		Meeks, Meeks.  				MEEKS 		...cutting through the forest with a 		golden track.		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 		the black, 		cutting through the forest with a golden 		track. Knox picks up a metal container and begins using it as a drum. Theother boys stand and begin going in a circle, making music withsticks of wood, combs, etc. 		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 		the black, 		cutting through the forest with a golden 		track. 		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 		the black, 		cutting through the forest with a golden 		track.  				BOYS 		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 		the black, 		cutting through the forest with... The boys continue to chant the chorus as they emerge from thecave. EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHTThe clock tolls two as the boys silently run back to their dorm. INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY Keating is walking to the front of the classroom filled with students. 				KEATING		A man is not very tire, he is exhausted.		And don't use very sad, use- He points to the back of the classroom. 				KEATING		Come on, Mr. Overstreet, you twerp, 				KNOX		Morose?  				KEATING		Exactly! Morose. Now, language was 		developed for one endeavor, and that is? 		Mr. Anderson? Come on! Are you a man or 		an amoeba? Keating stands before Todd's desk. Todd looks up nervously butsays nothing. Keating paused for a moment before looking away. 				KEATING		Mr. Perry?  				NEIL		Uh, to communicate.  				KEATING		No! To woo women. Today we're going to 		be talking about William Shakespeare.  The class lets out a collective sigh.				BOY		Oh, God!  				KEATING		I know. A lot of you looked forward to 		this about as much as you look forward 		to root canal work. We're gonna talk 		about Shakespeare as someone who writes 		something very interesting. Now, many of 		you have seen Shakespeare done very much 		like this: Keating holds out his right arm dramtically and begins tospeak in an exaggerated British accent. 		"O Titus, bring your friend hither." But		if any of you have seen Mr. Marlon Brando,		you know, Shakespeare can be different. 		"Friend, Romans, countrymen, lend me your		ears." You can also imagine, maybe, John		Wayne as Macbeth going, "Well, is this a 		dagger I see before me?" INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY The students are all seated together near the front of the room asKeating reads from a book. 				KEATING		"Dogs, sir? Oh, not just now. I do enjoy 		a good dog once in a while, sir. You can 		have yourself a three-course meal from 		one dog. Start with your canine 		crudites, go to your Fido flambe for 		main course and for dessert, a Pekingese 		parfait. And you can pick your teeth 		with a little paw." INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY The students are all back in their normal seats and Keating leapsup onto his desk. 				KEATING		Why do I stand up here? Anybody?  				CHARLIE		To feel taller.  				KEATING		No!Keating rings the bell on his desk with his foot 				KEATING		Thank you for playing, Mr. Dalton. I 		stand upon my desk to remind yourself 		that we must constantly look at things 		in a different way.  Keating glances around the classroom from atop the desk. 				KEATING		You see, the world looks very different 		from up here. You don't believe me? Come 		see for yourself. Come on. Come on!  Charlie and Neil quickly rise from their seats to go to the frontof the classroom. The rest of the class follows them. While Keatingcontinues speaking, Neil and Charlie join him on the desk and thenKeating jumps down.  				KEATING		Just when you think you know something, 		you have to look at it in another way. 		Even though it may seem silly or wrong, 		you must try! Now, when you read, don't 		just consider what the author thinks. 		Consider what you think.  				KEATING		Boys, you must strive to find your own 		voice. Because the longer you wait to 		begin, the less likely you are to find 		it at all. Thoreau said, "Most men lead 		lives of quiet desperation." Don't be 		resigned to that. Break out! Keating notices Spaz and another boy leaving the desk immediately. 				KEATING		Don't just walk off the edge like lemmings.		Look around you.  The school bell rings as the boys continue to climb onto the desk.Keating begins to gather up his stuff. The clock begins to toll asKeating walks to the back of the class. 				KEATING		There! There you go, Mr. Priske. Thank 		you! Yes! Dare to strike out and find 		new ground. Now, in addition to your 		essays, I would like you to compose a 		poem of your own, an original work. The students begin to groan. Keating begins flickering the lightsoff and on while chanting ominously. 				KEATING		That's right! You have to deliver it 		aloud in front of the class on Monday. 		Bonne chance, gentlemen.  Keating steps out into the hall before quickly peeking back in once again.Todd is the last one to stand on the desk and is about to jump off. 				KEATING		Mr. Anderson? Don't think that I don't 		know that this assignment scares the 		hell out of you, you mole. Keating flicks the light off, leaving Todd to jump down in the darknessas the students laugh. EXT. RIVER - DAY Cameron, Charlie, and several other boys are rowing while Mr. Nolanshouts orders from a bullhorn. 				MR. NOLAN		Take a power train in two! Three! Keep 		your eyes in the boat! EXT. CAMPUS ROOFTOP - DAY Noisy static is replaced by music as Pitts climbs down form the peak tojoin Meeks at their makeshift radio. 				MEEKS		We got it, Pittsie. We got it! Radio 		Free America!   EXT CAMPUS - DAY Several students are fencing on a grassy slope. EXT. CAMPUS ROOFTOP - DAY Meeks and Pitts perform a goofy dance together to the music. INT. TODD'S ROOM - DAY Todd is on his bed trying to write a poem. The door opens and Toddturns his writing pad over. Neil enters the room laughing. He crouchesdown next to Todd's bed and plunks a sheet of paper in Todd's lap.  				NEIL		I found it.  				TODD		You found what?  				NEIL		What I wanna do right now. What's 		really, really inside me.  				TODD		"A Midsummer Night's Dream"?  				NEIL		This is it.  				TODD		What is this?  				NEIL		It's a play, dummy.  				TODD		I know that. I-- Wh-Wh-What does it have 		to do with you?  				NEIL		Right. They're putting it on at Henley 		Hall. Open tryouts. Open tryouts!  				TODD		Yes, so? Neil pounds on the bed and then pulls a blanket off his bed,wearing it like a cloak. 				NEIL		So, I'm gonna act. Yes, yes! I'm gonna 		be an actor! Ever since I can remember, 		I've wanted to try this. I even tried to 		go to summer stock auditions last year, 		but, of course, my father wouldn't let 		me. For the first time in my whole life 		I know what I wanna do. Neil grabs a handful of papers off Todd's bed and tosses them intothe air. 				NEIL		and for the first time I'm gonna do it 		whether my father wants me to or not!		Carpe diem!  				TODD		Neil, Neil, hold on a minute. How are 		you gonna be in a play if your father 		won't let you?  				NEIL		First I gotta get the part, then I can 		worry about that.  				TODD		Yeah, but won't he kill you if he finds 		out you went to an audition and didn't 		even tell him?  				NEIL		No, no, no, no. As far as I'm concerned, 		he won't have to know about any of this.  				TODD		Well, that's impossible.  				NEIL		Bullshit! Nothing's impossible.  				TODD		Well, why don't you just call him and 		ask him? And m-maybe he'll say yes.  				NEIL		That's a laugh! Neil tosses the blanket back onto his bed. 				NEIL		If I don't ask him, at least I won't		be disobeying him.  				TODD		Yeah, but if he said--  				NEIL			   (shouting angrily)		Jesus, Todd! Whose side are you on? Todd says nothing. Neil looks at him for a moment and then takesthe flyer back from Todd. He walks over to the window, his excitement gone. 				NEIL		I mean, I haven't even gotten the part 		yet. Can't I even enjoy the idea for a 		little while?  Once again, Todd says nothing. After a moment, Neil sits on theheater and Todd returns to his poem. 				NEIL		You're coming to the meeting this 		afternoon?  				TODD		I don't know. Maybe. 				NEIL		Nothing Mr. Keating has to say means 		shit to you, does it, Todd?  				TODD		W-What is that supposed to mean?  				NEIL		You're in the club! Being in the club 		means being stirred up by things. You 		look about as stirred up as a cesspool.  Neil gets up from the window and stands over Todd. 				TODD		So- You want me out?  				NEIL		No! I want you in, but being in means 		you gotta do something. Not just say 		you're in.  				TODD		Well, listen, Neil. I-I appreciate this 		concern, but I-I'm not like you. All 		right? You, you, you say thing and 		people listen. I'm, I'm not like that.  				NEIL		Don't you think you could be?  				TODD		No! I--I, I don't know, but that's not 		the point. The, the, the point is that 		there's nothing you can do about it, so 		you can just butt out. I can take care 		of myself just fine. All right?  				NEIL		No.  				TODD		What do you mean, "no"?  A smile comes to Neil's face. 				NEIL		No.  Neil grabs Todd's notebook of poetry and runs across the room with it. Todd leaps up after him. 				TODD		Give me-- Neil. Neil, give that back.  The two begin racing in circles around the room, jumping frombed to bed as Todd tries to grab his poem back. 				NEIL		"We are dreaming of a--" Poetry! I'm 		being chased by Walt Whitman! Okay, 		okay. Neil drops the notebook. Cameron walks into the room. 				CAMERON		What are you guys doing? I'm sure-- You 		see this chemistry- Cameron tries to hold up his book and Neil snatches it from his hands andsuddenly all three of them are racing around the room. 				CAMERON		Hey, give me-- Neil, give me-- Don't be		immature. Come on. I need my-  Charlie enters the room and begins waving his hands. 				CHARLIE		Give it to me! Give it to me!  				NEIL		Charlie! Neil tosses Cameron's book to Charlie. 				CAMERON		Let me have my book, I need my-  The four boys continue racing around the cramped quarters, tossingCameron's book back and forth. Neil picks up a recorder and beginsblowing erratic notes on it while Charlie starts pounding on a set ofbongo drums. Outside the room a crowd of boys watch. EXT. CAMPUS ENTRANCE - DAY Knox is riding his bike around in circles near the entrance. Seeing noone nearby, he races through the open gates and down the road. He comesto the top of a hill and then goes downhill across the grass, shoutingas he sends an immense flock of geese flying into the air. EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY A number of vehicles drive up, filled with students dressed in bright redcosyumes, playing trumpets and various other instruments as they pass.Knox watches the growing crowd of students. They are all converging ona bus. A football player, wearing a horned helmet, dances on the roof ofthe bus. A band is playing while a group of cheerleaders are practising.Knox spots Chris amongst the cheerleaders. He watches her until Chetcomes along and she grabs hold of his hand. Knox looks away in disgust. 				COACH		Okay, everybody on the bus. Let's go, 		boys. Come on, let's go. On the bus, 		boys. Now! Chris jumps into Chet's arms as everyone begins to board the buses. Knoxturns his bike around and leaves. EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY Keating walks across the field, followed by his students. He kicks a ballahead of him while he carries a number of other balls in a net slung overhis shoulder. 				KEATING		Now, devotees may argue that one sport 		or game is inherently better than 		another. For me, sport is actually a 		chance for us to have other human beings 		push us to excel. I want you all to come 		over here and take a slip of paper and 		line up single file. Keating reaches the stands. He tosses the balls aside and pulls setshis briefcase down. As the boys line up he begins ripping off slipsof paper from a notepad and handing them out. 				KEATING		Mr. Meeks, time to inherit the earth. 		Mr. Pitts, rise above your name. He hands the notepad to another student. 				KEATING		I want you to hand these out to the boys,		one apiece. EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY The students are all lined up in single file, each holding a slipof paper. Keating blows his whistle. 				KEATING		You know what to do, Pitts.  				PITTS		"Oh to struggle against great odds. To 		meet enemies undaunted."  				KEATING		Sounds to me like you're daunted. Say it 		again like you're undaunted.  				PITTS		"Oh to struggle against great odds. To 		meet enemies undaunted."  				KEATING		Now go on. Pitts gives one of the soccer balls a good kick. 				KEATING		Yes! Next. One of the students sets up the next ball as the line advances. 				BOY 1		"To be a sailor of the world, bound for 		all ports."  				KEATING		Next. Louder!  				BOY 2		"Oh, I live to be the ruler of life, not 		a slave."  Keating walks away and starts up a record player. 				BOY 3		"To mount the scaffolds. To advance to 		the muzzle of guns with perfect 		nonchalance." Classical music begins playing on the phonograph. Meeks goes toread next but is confused by the music. 				KEATING		Come on, Meeks! Listen to the music.  				MEEKS		"To dance, clap hands, exalt, shout, 		skip, roll on, float on."  				KEATING		Yes!  				HOPKINS				(without energy)		"Oh, to have life henceforth the poem of 		new joys."  Hopkins crumples up his paper and then barely taps the soccerball with his foot. Keating puts a look of disgust on his face. 				KEATING		Oh! Boo! Come on, Charlie, let it fill 		your soul!  Charlie raises his hands over his head. 				CHARLIE		"To indeed be a god!"  INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY Neil is racing down the hallway, all excited. 				NEIL		Charlie, I got the part! I'm gonna play 		Puck! I'm gonna play Puck! He pounds on Charlie's door. 				MEEKS		What did he say?  				PITTS		Puck?  				NEIL		That's the main part.  				KNOX		Great, Neil.  				NEIL		Charlie, I got it!  				CHARLIE		Congratulations. Good for you, Neil. 		Good for you.  Neil enters his room with Todd and sits down at his typewriter. 				NEIL		Okay, okay, okay, okay.  				TODD		Neil, how are you gonna do this?  				NEIL		They need a letter of permission from my 		father and Mr. Nolan.  				TODD		You're not gonna write it.  				NEIL		Oh yes, I am.  				TODD		Oh, Neil. Neil, you're crazy.   Neil begins typing. 				    NEIL		Okay. "I am writing to you on behalf of 		my son Neil Perry." Neil begins laughing and stomping his feet up and down. 				    NEIL		This is great. EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT A lone bagpiper plays out on the dock. INT. TODD'S ROOM - NIGHT Todd is pacing circles about his room as he reads his poem. Hispacing slows and then he tears the poem up. INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY Knox stands at the front of the room with his poem in hand. 				KNOX				(quietly)		"To Chris." Charlie looks up from his desk with a grin. 				BOY 1		Who's Chris?  				BOY 2		Mmm, Chris.  				KNOX		I see a sweetness in her smile. 		Blight light shines from her eyes. 		But life is complete; contentment is 		mine, 		Just knowing that... Several students begin to snicker. 				KNOX		just knowing that she's alive. Knox crumples his poem and walks back to his desk. 				KNOX		Sorry, Captain. It's stupid.  				KEATING		No, no. It's not stupid. It's a good 		effort. It touched on one of the major 		themes, love. A major theme not only in 		poetry, but life. Mr. Hopkins, you were 		laughing. You're up. Hopkins slowly walks to the front of the class and unfoldshis piece of paper. 				HOPKINS		"The cat sat on the mat."  				KEATING		Congratulations, Mr. Hopkins. Yours is 		the first poem to ever have a negative 		score on the Pritchard scale. We're not 		laughing at you, we're laughing near 		you. I don't mind that your poem had a 		simple theme. Sometimes the most 		beautiful poetry can be about simple 		things, like a cat, or a flower or rain. 		You see, poetry can come from anything 		with the stuff of revelation in it. Just 		don't let your poems be ordinary. Now, 		who's next?  Keating approaches Todd's desk. 				KEATING		Mr. Anderson, I see you sitting there in 		agony. Come on, Todd, step up. Let's put 		you out of your misery.  				TODD		I, I didn't do it. I didn't write a 		poem.  				KEATING		Mr. Anderson thinks that everything 		inside of him is worthless and 		embarrassing. Isn't that right, Todd? 		Isn't that your worst fear? Well, I 		think you're wrong. I think you have 		something inside of you that is worth a 		great deal. Keating walks up to the blackboard and begins to write. 				KEATING		"I sound my barbaric yawp over the 		rooftops of the world." W. W. Uncle Walt 		again. Now, for those of you who don't 		know, a yawp is a loud cry or yell. Now, 		Todd, I would like you to give us a 		demonstration of a barbaric "yawp." Come 		on. You can't yawp sitting down. Let's 		go. Come on. Up. Todd reluctantly stands and follows Keating to the front. 				KEATING		You gotta get in "yawping" stance.  				TODD		A yawp? 				KEATING		No, not just a yawp. A barbaric yawp.  				TODD				(quietly)		Yawp.  				KEATING		Come on, louder.  				TODD				(quietly)		Yawp.  				KEATING		No, that's a mouse. Come on. Louder.  				TODD		Yawp.  				KEATING		Oh, good God, boy. Yell like a man!  				TODD				(shouting)		Yawp!  				KEATING		There it is. You see, you have a 		barbarian in you, after all. Todd goes to return to his seat but Keating stops him. 				KEATING		Now, you don't get away that easy. Keating turns Todd around and points out a picture on the wall. 				KEATING		The picture of Uncle Walt up there. What 		does he remind you of? Don't think. 		Answer. Go on. Keating begins to circle around Todd. 				TODD		A m-m-madman.  				KEATING		What kind of madman? Don't think about 		it. Just answer again.  				TODD		A c-crazy madman.  				KEATING		No, you can do better than that. Free up 		your mind. Use your imagination. Say the 		first thing that pops into your head, 		even if it's total gibberish. Go on, go 		on.  				TODD		Uh, uh, a sweaty-toothed madman.  				KEATING		Good God, boy, there's a poet in you, 		after all. There, close your eyes. Close 		your eyes. Close 'em. Now, describe what 		you see.  Keating puts his hands over Todd's eyes and they begin to slowlyspin around. 				TODD		Uh, I-I close my eyes.  				KEATING		Yes?  				TODD		Uh, and this image floats beside me.  				KEATING		A sweaty-toothed madman?  				TODD		A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare 		that pounds my brain.  				KEATING		Oh, that's excellent. Now, give him 		action. Make him do something.  				TODD		H-His hands reach out and choke me.  				KEATING		That's it. Wonderful. Wonderful. Keating removes his hands from Todd but Todd keeps his eyesclosed. 				TODD		And, and all the time he's mumbling.  				KEATING		What's he mumbling?  				TODD		M-Mumbling, "Truth. Truth is like, like 		a blanket that always leaves your feet 		cold."  The students begin to laugh and Todd opens his eyes. Keatingquickly gestures for him to close them again. 				KEATING
