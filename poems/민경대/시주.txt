시주  시주는 나의 시 전집을 한권 가지는 일이다 나의 인생이 다 들어 있고 upgrade해주는 시집한권을 시주이고 두권은 invest같은 poetry invest 이다Robert Frost     Investment  Over back where they speak of life as staying ('You couldn't call it living, for it ain't'), There was an old, old house renewed with paint, And in it a piano loudly playing. Out in the plowed ground in the cold a digger, Among unearthed potatoes standing still, Was counting winter dinners, one a hill, With half an ear to the piano's vigor http://investmentpoetry.com/ Welcome to Investment Poetry, the natural follow-on to The Deipnosophist. To me, investing is about more than charts and numbers. Where The Deipnosophist led with “Where the science of investing becomes the art of living,” we continue with Investment Poetry, where “rhyme plus reason equals investment success.” Investment Poetry will focus more on nuts and bolts investing than does The Deipnosophist. I hope to provide more real time investment opportunities, but always with the assumption that you, the reader and subscriber, have done your homework. Which means you must be more engaged than previously. Interested readers should subscribe, as a measure of your commitment. I view this subscription fee as tuition for your investment success rather than  remuneration for my investment ideas. And for access to a community of similar-minded investors. Please take every advantage of this opportunity: Reach out to your fellow readers, in addition to me. Challenge my reasoning and rationale, and direct the conversation as you deem appropriate. I hope we all can help each other learn and grow. I look forward to our discussions. Sincerely,David M. Gordon
