Poem and Money  시와 돈은 사춘이다시가 돈이고 돈이 시다 그런데시는 시고돈은 돈이다 나는 돈을 시로보지도 시를 돈으로도 보지 못하고시는 군고구마다타도 먹어야하고 생고구마도 먹어야한다아직 덜익은 시도 대중한테 먹여야 한다땅콩는 시인은 접시가가 아니어도 먹는다시는 바로 땅콩이다 Money is a kind of poetry.- Wallace Stevens Money, the long green,cash, stash, rhino, jackor just plain dough. Chock it up, fork it over,shell it out. Watch itburn holes through pockets. To be made of it! To have itto burn! Greenbacks, double eagles,megabucks and Ginnie Maes. It greases the palm, feathers a nest,holds heads above water,makes both ends meet. Money breeds money.Gathering interest, compounding daily.Always in circulation. Money. You don't know where it's been,but you put it where your mouth is.And it talks.   http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/money/   Poems about Work and Moneypoem: work and money    Money is a kind of poetry. - Wallace Stevens            Without the benefit of wealthy patrons, most poets these days must be gainfully employed. And even though remembering to pay the mortgage or sitting down to the daily grind hardly seems a catalyst for poetic inspiration, employment and money are often negotiated and explored in thoughtful, and sometimes frustrated, verses.  In John Ashbery’s poem “The Instruction Manual," the speaker is at work writing a technical manual, but gazing out the window:   “As I sit looking out of a window of the building I wish I did not have to write the instruction manual on the uses of a new metal.  I look down into the street and see people, each walking with an  inner peace,  And envy them--they are so far away from me!  Not one of them has to worry about getting out this manual on schedule. ” For the rest of the poem, the speaker is transported away from the prosaic working world into the world of his own devising; he begins by imagining “dim Guadalajara! City of rose-colored flowers!” From there, the poem spirals outward, encompassing a brilliant range of image and emotion, though the narrator has never left the office.  The worker in Gary Snyder’s poem “Hay for the Horses” is much more bitter, looking back on his career:   ““I’m sixty-eight” he said,  “I first bucked hay when I was seventeen.  I thought, that day I started,  I sure would hate to do this all my life.  And dammit, that’s just what I’ve gone and done.” ” There is, of course, a rich tradition of poets needing, seeking, despising, loving, and refusing money and the material world. In the sixteenth century, Barnabe Googe eloquently described why an impoverished poet might put more importance on cold hard cash than on his dearest friends:   “Give money me, take friendship whoso list,  For friends are gone, come once adversity,  When money yet remaineth safe in chest,  That quickly can thee bring from misery;  Fair face show friends when riches do abound;  Come time of proof, farewell, they must away” In a kinder and less materialistic contemporary poem, “Leave New York," Joshua Beckman writes about the seductive material lure of New York City, turning away from everything he would like to buy, refusing even to spend his money on books of poetry:   “Do not spend $1.00 on two scallion pancakes.  Do not hail a ten dollar cab to blow off steam and smoke his back seat up and watch the meter jump by quarters.  Do not spend $7.50 on AXE HANDLES by Gary Snyder Do not spend $35.00 on the collected anyone. ” An important sub-category of the work poem is poetry written by women about the sometimes servile and humiliating tasks associated with domestic labor or office work. For example, Rita Dove‘s book Thomas and Beulah, a verse cycle based on the lives of Dove’s grandparents, deals in part with the work of the home--dusting, washing, cleaning, cooking. And poets such as Sylvia Plath and Marge Piercy have written about working in male-dominated offices. The speaker in Piercy’s poem “The Secretary Chant," for example, has come to be defined so much by her job that she reimagines her own body is made of her job’s constituent parts:   “My hips are a desk.  From my ears hang chains of paper clips.  Rubber bands form my hair.  My breasts are wells of mimeograph ink.  My feet bear casters.  Buzz. Click. ” Here are some meditations on work and money: "Blues" by Elizabeth Alexander  “The Instruction Manual” by John Ashbery “Leave New York” by Joshua Beckman “The Executive” by John Betjeman “Work Without Hope” by Samuel Taylor ColeridgeThomas and Beulah by Rita Dove “On Money” by Barnabe Googe “Seams” by Hazel Hall "Po’ Boy Blues" by Langston Hughes  "Coming Close" by Philip Levine  “The Village Blacksmith” by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow "Black Nikes" by Harryette Mullen  “The Wasted Day” by Robert F.

I hadn’t given thought to either of these words [“difficulty” and “danger”] until this panel was announced to me. And then I was obliged to give thought to them and realized that the brilliant jottings that I’d made in the middle of the night were, in fact, misperceptions of the questions involved and couldn’t be used. It seems to me that the idea of danger, as Jim [James Longenbach] suggests, is enormously self-flattering to the writer and that the only danger to the writer, really, is self-delusion—but the problem of self-delusion is that it’s essential to the getting-on-paper of the poem. You have to believe that what you’re doing as you’re working has the makings of a miraculous utterance, you have to believe it. But if you continue to believe it, in the absence of evidence, if you begin to think that if nobody seems to like your poem it’s because your poem is so harrowing and so violently perceptive that people are fleeing from it—that response needs to be examined. Basically, it seems to me, you write to surprise yourself, to stay awake, to make of writing a continued adventure. And this has nothing to do with words like “difficulty” and “danger.” And, in fact, poems make their audiences. Each great poem teaches its readers how to read it. But that can happen over time, and the problem is that you don’t know whether yours is one of these poems that will instruct a generation in an art, or is it one of those poems that will be used as a terrible example of the writer’s narcissism? http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/what-sylvia-plath-loved  http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/poems-about-work-and-money
