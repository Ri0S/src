The Bird of Imaging  There was a bird no one had ever seen before.A bird whose feathers caught the colorsof light shining through them,so that each featherreflected the hues of all the daysand alll the nights.  There was a bird no one had ever seen before.A bird whose eyes could feel the timeof what had been and what will be--and feelling the life of all this time,could see inside and outside of what it saw.  There was a bird no one had ever seen before.A bird whose wings gathered the air around them,filling the weight of those wings with the breathing of   creatures,listening in suspense, to other soinds.  There was a bird no one had ever seen before.A bird whose voices wwre the words of dreams,changing into the songs that brought the stars closer,sp they could have the warmth of their singing nearby.  There was a bird no one ever seen before,and it was--ourselves, ready to be in the sky of our thoughts,to be the dreaming of our night into day, to be speaking of our words into song,to be the feet of our dance,to be the music of our play.  There was a bird no one had ever seen before,and it flew--and nothing,and no one,was ever the same afterwards....
