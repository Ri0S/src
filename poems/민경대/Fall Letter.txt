fall letter  Autumn LetterI want to write a letter to someone in the autumnIn the Autumn, I see lonely fountain streamed from a deep valleyAnd want to wet the lonely heartI write a letter in the autumn night but knowing that cannot be sent in the morningNow there is a postman who delivers letters in the air in the days and nightsSo I am sending lettersI regret but the unsent letters always cryI send the thread tied letters in the air without stampsThe letters of the poet opens its eyes with holding their breaths
