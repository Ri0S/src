Primrose Hill  한 한국 소녀가 내가 걸어간 길을 간다다시 한번 가보아야할 길 소녀의 중얼거리는 소리는 시도 노래도 말도 모두 이국에서 느끼는 한 소설 동경속에 살아 있는 나의 외로움의 골짜기 혹은 언덕 다시 보아야할 시간의 편지여기에 와본 사람은 행복을 느낀다 런던 아이가 보이는 캐드먼에서   Went to see the sun go down on Primrose Hill The Sunday evening sun go down on Primrose Hill Never could be anything else Never should be anything else Cos I like that kind of lifeI like that kind of life. Never thinking too far ahead Hanging high, I fall to bed That’s the only kind of life I’ve led Just the pictures in your room Smell the rose’s sweet perfume While you’re around, you’ve got to hear this tune And all those groovy guysAnd all those groovy guys. We went to see the sun go down on Primrose Hill The Sunday evening sun go down on Primrose Hill Never could be anything else Never should be anything else Cos I like that kind of lifeI like that kind of life Do you like that kind of life? Do you like that kind of life? Do you like that kind of life?     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yDVGIRj1pU          Primrose Hill Went to see the sun go down on Primrose Hill The Sunday evening sun go down on Primrose Hill Never could be anything else Never should be anything else Cos I like that kind of lifeI like that kind of life. Never thinking too far ahead Hanging high, I fall to bed That’s the only kind of life I’ve led Just the pictures in your room Smell the rose’s sweet perfume While you’re around, you’ve got to hear this tune And all those groovy guysAnd all those groovy guys. We went to see the sun go down on Primrose Hill The Sunday evening sun go down on Primrose Hill Never could be anything else Never should be anything else Cos I like that kind of lifeI like that kind of life Do you like that kind of life? Do you like that kind of life? Do you like that kind of life?                         Primrose Hill Went to see the sun go down on Primrose Hill The Sunday evening sun go down on Primrose Hill Never could be anything else Never should be anything else Cos I like that kind of lifeI like that kind of life. Never thinking too far ahead Hanging high, I fall to bed That’s the only kind of life I’ve led Just the pictures in your room Smell the rose’s sweet perfume While you’re around, you’ve got to hear this tune And all those groovy guysAnd all those groovy guys. We went to see the sun go down on Primrose Hill The Sunday evening sun go down on Primrose Hill Never could be anything else Never should be anything else Cos I like that kind of lifeI like that kind of life Do you like that kind of life? Do you like that kind of life? Do you like that kind of life?
