이디엄1 나에는 꼭 하나의 이디엄이 작동된다돈만 보면 물쓰듯 돈을 쓴다  Money burning a hole in my pocket - what to buy for $200-400? Although I've spent too much on gear in the last 6-12 months already, I was recently given some cash to spend on my habit. So what do you think I should spend it on? Or save it? I used to shoot mostly travel (vacation) stuff but now have a 2 year old, so 90% of my photography is of him. I just don't have the time to go out on my own, really, ever. I carry around the V1 plus 3 lenses about 50% of the time, the D7K with 1-3 lenses about 30% of the time, and the V1 plus 3 lenses AND the D7K with a prime about 20% of the time - mostly when we're going to hit a museum/indoor place where the V1 ISO just won't cut it. Here's my current wish list and gear list. I am leaning toward the Rokinon, but interested in thoughts on what I may be missing. Wish list:•Rokinon 8mm fisheye (~$300) - Brand new perspective on life•eBay radio flash triggers, umbrella setup (~$200) - I currently have two flashes but only one umbrella setup, and no great way to use both of them off camera at the same time. I have been fiddling around with Strobist techniques recently.•A bag that will carry the V1 + D7K setup - Currently I only have a big KATA backpack that carries it all, which is overkill. Recommendations appreciated here.•SB-N5/SB-N7 flash for V1 - So I can maybe leave the D7K at home more often?•V1 FT-1 adapter (~$200) - Use all of my F-mount lenses on the V1 and get super zoom capability. But, I don't get a lot of chances to shoot wildlife, unless it's at the zoo.•Nikon 55-200 VR Refurb ($99) - I rarely carry the 70-200 because it's too big. I don't really have a walkaround zoom.•Save for used 18-55 f/2.8 (~$700?) - for better portraits of the kid, but maybe not better than whatever prime I have with me•Save for V1 6.7-13 - but I already have too many V1 lenses•Membership to Lens Lust Anonymous - quit spending and start shooting!  Gear list: Nikon D700035/1.8 AFS, 50/1.8 AF, 85/1.8 AFSigma 10-20Tamron 90mm MacroNikon 70-200 2.8 VRIINikon TC-17IINikon 18-70 4-5.6 (D70 kit lens)SB-600SB-26Gitz Mountaineer + Kirk BH-1Nikon V1 10/2.8, 18.5/1.8, 10-30 VR, 30-110 VR, 11-27.5
