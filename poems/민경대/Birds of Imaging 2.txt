Birds of Imaging 2 My bird moves swiftlythrough the land.It's very special.It has a great homeof wonder. The bird of imaginationhas to get born because it itdidn,t get born, weÂ  wouldn't beable to get it out of our minds  The bird makeseverything come alive.She makes dead flowersbecome into alive flowers.  My bird comes out at night on a full moon. He flies through the sky.At night you can never see him.He is in you.His name is imagination.He lives in a placecalled hearet brain body. It is in everyone.Some adults think it is childishbut it will never leave you even if you hide it. The shadow of the birdof imagination is heavierthan a thought. My bird of imaginatiuon can glow in the dark.
