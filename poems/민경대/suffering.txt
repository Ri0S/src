But your victories will never be lasting; that’s all." Rieux’s face darkened.  "Yes, I know that. But it’s no reason for giving up the struggle." "No reason, I agree. Only, I now can picture what this plague must mean for you." "Yes. A never ending defeat."… "Who taught you all this, doctor?" The reply came promptly:  "Suffering." (2.7.66-75)   “You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.”   http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/272049-who-taught-you-all-this-doctor-the-reply-came-promptly
