Lady Gregory is a woman of world; she is passionate, candid, sexy but rather harsh in her talk. In this poem, she acts as the mouth-piece for a sane philosophy that both the body and soul are the creations of God and are pure and pious. Sex is a part of life but it should not be used for something wicked. To have an integrated personality, experiencing normal sex life is needed. Even saints and philosophers have harped on the idea of physical love needed to attain divine love. The Bishop regards love as something foul and sinful. Jane retorts him by saying that the seat of love-the private organs-is the place of excrement. Physical love is necessary for a full life. SUMMARY: Stanza 1: Jane meets the Bishop on the road and they hold a conversation. The Bishop beseeches her to lead a virtuous life. The Bishop tells Jane that her breasts are flat and old and her views will get stiff on account of old age. He urges her to give up this sinful life which is as dirty as a pig-sty and lead a virtuous and healthy life so that she can secure a safe place in Heaven.  Stanza 2: Jane replies the Bishop that good and evil are closely inter-connected to each other; good needs evil as a complement; one is incomplete without the other. She retorts and says that her friends were as sexy as her and they have not been denied any honour or grave after their death. They were experts in bodily vice but were also proud of their pure hearts.   Stanza 3: Jane further tells the Bishop that woman should be proud and strong in matters related to love. Love has its dwelling in the place of excrement. Love finds satisfaction in the filthy organs of the body. The virginity of a woman can only be completed by consummation. ANALYSIS:   Structure: The poem, “Crazy Jane Talks With The Bishop” consists of three stanzas each having six lines. The dialogue that takes place between Jane and the Bishop is rapid and sharp. Jane’s philosophy is the same and convincing. The poem is noteworthy for the blending of the sensuous with the noble, the petty with the significant, and the gay with the heroic.    Crazy Jane Talks with the Bishop: William Butler Yeats - Summary and Critical Analysis A woman named Jane, old and mentally deranged, chanced to meet a Bishop while walking along a road. The Bishop admonishes her for her unholy way of life and exhorts her to mend her ways and lead a pious virtuous life. He points out to her that she was growing old, her breasts were flat and fallen and her veins would soon be dried.    William Butler Yeats    Therefore, said the Bishop, she should lead a religious life free from sensual proclivities. But Crazy Jane doesn’t take the Bishop’s advice seriously. She retorts by saying that fair and foul, virtue and vice, body and soul are unavoidably co-existent; and life is complete only by the union of such opposites. Life becomes an integrated whole when body and soul work in harmony. The body is not to be hated or neglected, physical pleasure is also a truth of life. The body must not be starved of its needs for the sake of the soul. Good and evil are necessary ingredients in the composition of human life, and good exist only in company with the evil. We cannot accept the one and deny the other, the whole can be achieved only when a foul is also accepted along with the fair. The poem is in three stanzas. Each stanza contains six lines. It is a brisk and a hard-hitting dialogue of this Crazy-Jane (who is a slut, a terrible satirist) and the Bishop. Even in her old age she is after the sexual life. A Bishop reprimands her and tells her that her breasts are flat and fallen now. Those veins must soon be dry. But no sooner than religious man begins to deliver his homily, she overlaps his authority with a good practical philosophy. Bishop’s point is that she should live a more religious life. Instead of feeling ashamed she turns savagely on the Bishop and argues that love and lust should be accepted as an important part of life. She gives her argument a philosophical twist. She points out that love has pitched his mansion in the place of excrement, and ends with the statement of the Platonic opposites. Crazy Jane’s philosophy is Yeats’s own philosophy of those days. Through the mouth of Crazy Jane, the poet has succeeded in driving home the truth that body and soul are God’s creation, hence, the two are equally holy. Yeats was almost seventy when he wrote this poem, and like many of the other poems of that age it expresses his own renewed passion of life and for love.
