More Stones     차가 질주하는데많은  돌들이 가로막혀앞으로 나갈수가 없다점점 복잡해져 가는 시간이가고싶어도 갈수없는 이국의 시간엇갈린 부표들이 무거운 돌들이 눌려하늘로 날지 못하고낮설은 하늘아래 밤이 깊어가고2 그리고 하나 내곁을 사라지고나는 홀로 기다린다     Donald Justice has died twice:once in Miami, in the sun, on a Sunday,and once in Iowa City, on a Fridayin August, which was not withoutits own sun—if not bright spot. The first time he died, he was thinkingof Vallejo, who died in Paris, maybeon a Thursday, surely in rain.Vallejo died again in Paris,in April, of an unknown illnesswhich may have been malaria,as fictionalized in Bolano’sMonsieur Pain. “There is, brothers,very much to do,” Vallejo saidbetween his deaths, and Phil,you must have died once in Seville, in the land of Machado,before going again last Saturdayin Fresno, so you no longer writeto us or bring in trash bins filledwith light. Phil, I will die, maybeon a Sunday in Wellfleet, becausetoday it is Sunday, and iceis jamming the eaves, and thereis nowhere to put the snowthat keeps recalling allthose other snows—  Today it is wednesday. And big stoneIs blocked in the roadWhich keeps shouting allMy passport has died Until tomorrow
