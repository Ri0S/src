만일 존 스타인벡은 어떻게 죽었는가?    묻는 낟면  John Steinbeck died of heart failure in his New York City home on Dec. 20, 1968, at age 66. Steinbeck won the 1962 Nobel Prize for Literature and the Pulitzer Prize for "The Grapes of Wrath," a novel. Steinbeck's Final MonthsIn the months before his death, Steinbeck suffered from severe shortness of breath due to blocked coronary arteries and emphysema. In July 1968, he was hospitalized briefly and placed in an oxygen tent when his failing heart made it difficult to breathe. Blocked Coronary ArteriesSteinbeck's coronary arteries were so severely blocked that a sewing needle could not fit through them, according to his autopsy. His doctor and friend, Denton Cox, discussed coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (a newly developed procedure at that time), but they decided against it. Final WeeksIn early November, Steinbeck and his wife, Elaine, moved from their Sag Harbor home to their New York City apartment, where he was visited daily by Cox and where his breathing was eased with oxygen equipment. Dec. 20, 1968Elaine and her husband talked about their favorite memories, and she lay beside him in the late afternoon as he faded quietly into a coma and his heart stopped beating. Funeral and CremationAt his request, Steinbeck had an Episcopal funeral. Henry Fonda, who played Tom Joad in the movie "The Grapes of Wrath," spoke at the service. Steinbeck's remains were cremated and his ashes buried in Salinas, California, his birthplace.
