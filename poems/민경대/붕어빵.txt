붕어빵  나는 붕어빵 장수 나는 오늘부터 붕어빵을 판다bean-jam bun seller at Myeongdong, Seoul   In winter we see the hot bun sellers in the street more often than other seasons . It is baked in the iron cast. It's kind of bean-jam bun in the shape of a crucian (carp). At downtown of Myeongdong, near Sinsegye Department store I saw her at my age baking them. Of course I bought some and had them with friend sketchers while sketching her. Many tourists bought them. I heard that she originally sold fruits in that place and began to bake it for the fruits were frozen too much due to the colder weather than the previous years.              http://www.urbansketchers.org/2011/02/bean-jam-bun-seller-at-myeongdong-seoul.html
